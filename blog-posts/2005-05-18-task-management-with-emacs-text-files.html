<h1 class="title">Task management with Emacs: Text files</h1>

<p>
With the wealth of code available for Emacs and the ease of
 customization it provides, you're certain to find a task management
 tool that fits the way you think. Over the next few days, I'll provide
 a quick run-through of the methods I've tried out.
</p>

<p>
The simplest way to get started with Emacs for task management is to
 keep your TODOs in a plain text file, like ~/TODO. You can keep this
 text file in any format you want. To make it easier for you to see
 what you need to do, you can keep active TODOs near the top and
 completed tasks near the bottom.
</p>

<p>
If you load your TODO file every time you start up Emacs, then you'll
 be sure to check it every day. Put the following line in your ~/.emacs
 to have it automatically loaded when you start:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(find-file "~/TODO")
</pre>

<p>
You'll also want to make it easy to open during an Emacs session. If
 your TODO file is just a keyboard shortcut away, you'll find it easier
 to keep all of your reminders in the file. Here's a snippet that shows
 the TODO file in the current window.
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun my/todo ()
 "Bring up the TODO file."
 (interactive)
 (find-file "~/TODO")
 (goto-char (point-min)))

;; Now bind it to a convenient shortcut key
(global-set-key (kbd " ") 'my/todo)
</pre>

<p>
Now you can hit F5 F5 to show your TODO. If you want your TODO file to
 show up in another window, remove that and use this snippet instead:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun my/todo ()
 "Bring up the TODO file."
 (interactive)
 (find-file-other-window "~/TODO")
 (goto-char (point-min)))

;; Now bind it to a convenient shortcut key
(global-set-key (kbd " ") 'my/todo)
</pre>

<p>
If you want to be able to add stuff to your TODO without getting
 distracted from your work, add this to your ~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun my/add-todo (task)
 "Add a line to the TODO file."
 (interactive "MTask: ")
 (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect "~/TODO")
   (goto-char (point-min))
   (insert task "\n")
   (save-buffer)))
(global-set-key (kbd " t") 'my/add-todo)
</pre>

<p>
See? Emacs is fun and easy to configure. You can store your tasks in a
 plain text file and then add keyboard shortcuts to make your tasks
 easier to manage.

<p>
There are many sophisticated task management packages for Emacs. I'll
 write about one of them tomorrow. In the meantime, if you want to find
