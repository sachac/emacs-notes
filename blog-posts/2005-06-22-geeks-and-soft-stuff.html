Kathy Sierra
(<a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating
Passionate Users</a>) was surprised to
 find that
<a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/06/open_source_pas.html">geeks
are very interested in learning about “soft” topics like community.</a>
</p>

<p>
I'm \<sub>crazy\</sub>_ about my community of passionate users and co-developers.
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PlannerMode">The personal
information manager I maintain</a> gives me so many opportunities to
tailor it to fit people's individual quirks. I love getting things to
fit people. It's about people, not code. I love helping people become
more productive. Dominique says I'm wired differently. He hasn't met a
lot of maintainer-types; most open source developers he's met are just
happy to get something out there. Me, I get my kick out of the
relationship I build with the other people throughout the years. I get
my kick out of making people's lives easier. I don't write extremely
clever code, but I learn so much from them about the ways people plan!
</p>

<p>
I'm also crazy about organizing information and collecting knowledge.
<a href="http://www.online-learning.com/course_id_5.html">“So where are all the
Information Designers?”</a> gave me a name for my interest in wikis and
developing a culture of documentation in communities. Again, it's about
people! =) Sure, I have to know the technology to set up a good wiki and
customize it to their needs, but I'm really more focused on the process
and the culture.
</p>

<p>
Is it ungeeky to be interested in these things, to devour business and
 psychology books even more avidly than I do technical books? I don't
 think so. To me, people and organizations have even more complex and
 fascinating systems that I want to hack. They're way, way, way cool.
 I've come a long way since my “eewww, MIS!” days, and I look forward
 to learning more about the way people work.

I think that geeks would be more or less interested in communities
 because geeks like being in communities <b>laugh</b> That is purely my
 opinion though. But if you will observe the people into FOSS, we are
 all interacting on a regular basis, sharing tips and new developments
 or code. And if you think about it, if not for the community of
geeks,
 where would be FOSS now? ;) Maybe geeks aren't the typical sociable
 people but geeks seem to enjoy going together as groups :) I guess
 it's because geeks tend to have a certain focus on things we like in
 common but I suppose that not all geeks are out and out very
sociable.
 But the sense of community is definitely there. (But as I already
 mentioned earlier, this is purely my opinion, based on my
 experiences.)
