This entry is part 3 of 3 in the series <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/series/emacs-basics-2/">Emacs Basics</a>
</p>

<p>
Hello, I'm Sacha Chua, and this is an Emacs Basics video on customizing
Emacs. Emacs is incredibly flexible. You can tweak it to do much more
than you might expect from a text editor. This week, we're going to
focus on learning how to tweak Emacs with M-x customize and by editing
<code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>.

You can change tons of options through the built-in customization
interface. Explore the options by typing M-x customize. Remember, that's
Alt-x if you're using a PC keyboard and Option-x if you're on a Mac. So
for me, that's Alt-x customize &lt;Enter&gt;. In the future, I'll just refer
to this as the Meta key, so remember which key is equivalent to Meta on
your keyboard.

</p>

<p>
After you run <code>M-x customize</code>, you'll see different groups of options.
Click on the links to explore a group.
</p>

<p>
For example, people often want to change the backup directory setting.
This is the setting that controls where the backup files (the files
ending in <code>~</code>) are created. You've probably noticed that they clutter
your current directory by default. To change this setting, select the
<b>Files &gt; Backup</b> group. Look for the entry that says <b>Backup Directory
Alist.</b> Click on the arrow, or move your point to the arrow and press
&lt;Enter&gt;. Click on <b>INS</b>, or move your point to <b>INS</b> and press &lt;Enter&gt;.
Fill it in as follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Regexp matching filename: .
</li>
<li>Backup directory name: ~/.emacs.d/backups
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Click on <b>State</b> and choose <b>Save for future sessions</b>. This will save
your changes to <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>. When you're done, type q to close
the screen.
</p>

<p>
You can also jump straight to customizing a specific variable. For
example, if you want to change the way Emacs handles case-sensitive
search, you can use M-x customize-variable to set the case-fold-search
variable. By default, case fold search is on, which means that searching
for a lower-case “hello” will match an upper-case “HELLO” as well. If
you would like to change this so that lowercase only matches lowercase
and uppercase matches only uppercase, you can toggle this variable. I
like leaving case fold search on because it's more convenient for me. If
you make lots of changes, you can use the <b>Apply and Save</b> button to
save all the changes on your current screen.
</p>

<p>
Not sure what to customize? You can learn about options by browsing
through M-x customize or reading the manual (<b>Help &gt; Read the Emacs
Manual</b> or M-x info-emacs-manual). You can also search for keywords
using M-x customize-apropos.
</p>

<p>
The Customize interface lets you change lots of options, but not
everything can be changed through Customize. That's where your Emacs
configuration file comes in. This used to be a file called <code>~/.emacs</code> in
your home directory, and you'll still come across lots of pages that
refer to a <code>.emacs</code> file (or “dot emacs”). The new standard is to put
configuration code in your <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> file, which you can
create if it does not yet exist.
</p>

<p>
What goes into your <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> file? If you open it now,
you'll probably find the settings you saved using <code>M-x customize</code>. You
can also call functions, set variables, and even override the way Emacs
works. As you learn more about Emacs, you'll probably find Emacs Lisp
snippets on web pages and in manuals. For example, the Org manual
includes the following lines:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
(global-set-key "\C-cc" 'org-capture)
(global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
(global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-iswitchb)
</pre>

<p>
This code sets C-c l (that's Control-c l) to run <code>org-store-link</code>, C-c c
to run <code>org-capture</code>, C-c a to run <code>org-agenda</code>, and C-c b to run
<code>org-iswitchb</code>. You can add those to the end of your
<code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> file. They'll be loaded the next time you start
Emacs. If you want to reload your <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> without
restarting, use M-x eval-buffer.
</p>

<p>
Emacs Lisp may look strange. Don't worry, you can get the hang of it
even if you don't think of yourself as a programmer. You can start by
copying interesting snippets from other people's configuration files.
Start with small chunks instead of large ones, so you can test if things
work the way you want them to. If you need help,
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/emacs/info">StackOverflow</a> and other
Q&amp;A resources may be useful.
</p>

<p>
As you experiment with configuring Emacs, you may run into mistakes or
errors. You can find out whether it's a problem with Emacs or with your
configuration by loading Emacs with emacs -Q, which skips your
configuration. If Emacs works fine with your configuration, check your
<code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> to see which code messed things up. You can comment
out regions by selecting them and using M-x comment-region. That way,
they won't be evaluated when you start Emacs. You can uncomment them
with M-x uncomment-region.
</p>

<p>
Emacs gets even awesomer when you tailor it to the way you want to work.
Enjoy customizing it!
