<p>
I've been reading up on blogging, since I want to get a firm
 grip on the kind of software I'd like. Yes, I'm not supposed to be
 thinking about it right now, but I am. So, what am I looking for?
</p>

<p>
I seem to be looking for a strange mix between wiki and blog &#x2013; a
<a href="http://www.ourpla.net/cgi-bin/pikie.cgi?WikiWeblogs">WikiBlog</a>. I
want
 it to be easy for people to jump to today's entry, and I want it to be
 easy for them to look at all the pages I'd edited for the day. I want
 to make it easy for people to subscribe to pages they're interested in
 and to have the day's work delivered to them in their mailbox at, say,
 midnight the next day.
</p>

<p>
Bah. Forget them. ;) I want something that can organize information
 for myself. For the most part, planner mode and emacs-wiki
 suffice. But I also want to be able to make this information usable to
 other people, and that means formatting it nicely.
