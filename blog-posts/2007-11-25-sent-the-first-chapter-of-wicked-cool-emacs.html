Operating on the principle that it's better to have a terrible first
 draft than none at all, I've sent 21 pages to my editor at No Starch
 Press. =)
</p>

<p>
The past two weeks were incredibly packed, but I survived them and and
 seem to be getting the hang of working on the book. It's incredibly
 fun. Emacs is such a crazy subject to write about. I mean, come on&#x2026;
 Mayan date conversions? Emacs geeks! I'm sure that if I dug a little
 deeper, I'd figure out how to help W- keep track of his parents'
 Chinese birthdays. Now that would be useful! &lt;laugh&gt; Writing
 about Emacs gave me an excuse to explore. There's a lot in here that I
 haven't tried before, and you know what? It's pretty darn cool.
</p>

<p>
I was surprised to find that I had lots of material already. It didn't
 seem like it when I was writing, but the page count just kept growing
 and growing as I assembled the chapter. I'm not too happy with the way
 I wrote it, because it felt a little drier than I'm used to. I should
 probably browse through No Starch Press books and see which books in
 that line have been written really well so that I have role models.
</p>

<p>
I'll tweak the draft a little bit more and send it out to beta readers
 tomorrow. =)
