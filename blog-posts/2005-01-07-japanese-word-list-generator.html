MWAHAHAHAHA! I just pulled off a really neat Emacs
 hack. &lt;grin&gt; It's Japanese-related. So I've been
 translating this document for the past two days. It's really slow
 and boring work because there's no soft copy, so I have to write
 the characters (blurry because this is a photocopy of a
 photocopy) using the mouse, and hope I don't make any mistakes
 along the way. In the course of copying down kanji (Chinese
 characters) for later translation, I created a spreadsheet with
 two columns: the kanji word and the number of the slide it
 appears on. Then I exported that to CSV, opened that in Emacs,
 and wrote an Emacs Lisp function that split the words up into
 individual characters. I passed this through
 shell-command-on-region to sort and uniquify the characters. I
 then went back to the CSV with words and slide numbers, wrote
 another Emacs Lisp function that searched edict (Jim Breen's
 electronic Japanese dictionary) for the words, split the word
 into individual characters, and filed the word info under each
 character, also marking words that were not found in the
 dictionary. After that, I wrote yet another function to add table
 markup and individual character definitions to each line, then
 copied the result into an HTML file.

This should probably be rewritten as a Perl script.
