Ah, spam, the bane of our Internet lives. There is no completely
 reliable way to automatically filter spam. Spam messages that slip
 through the filters and perfectly legitimate messages that get
 labelled spam are all part of the occupational hazards of using the
 Internet.
</p>

<p>
The fastest way to filter spam is to use an external spam-filtering
 program such as Spamassassin or Bogofilter, so your spam can be
 filtered in the background and you don't have to spend time in Emacs
 filtering it yourself. In an ideal world, this would be done on the
 mail server so that you don't even need to download unwanted
 messages. If your inbox isn't full of ads for medicine or stocks, your
 mail server is probably doing a decent job of filtering the mail for
 you.

As spam filtering isn't an exact science, you'll want to find out how
 you can check your spam folder for misclassified mail. If you download
 your mail through POP, find out if there's a webmail interface that
 will allow you to check if any real mail has slipped into the junk
 mail pile. If you're on IMAP, your mail server might automatically
 file spam messages in a different group. Here's how to add the spam
 group to your list of groups:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Type M-x gnus to bring up the group buffer.
</li>
<li>Type \^ (gnus-group-enter-server-mode).
</li>
<li>Choose the nnimap: entry for your mail server and press RET
(gnus-server-read-server).
</li>
<li>Find the spam or junk mail group if it exists.
</li>
<li>Type u (gnus-browse-unsubscribe-current-group) to toggle the
subscription. Subscribed groups will appear in your M-x gnus screen
if they contain at least one unread message.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Another alternative is to have all the mail (spam and non-spam)
 delivered to your inbox, and then let Gnus be in charge of filing it
 into your spam and non-spam groups. If other people manage your mail
 server, ask them if you can have your mail processed by the spam
 filter but still delivered to your inbox. If you're administering your
 own mail server, set up a spam filtering system such as SpamAssassin
 or BogoFilter, then read the documentation of your spam filtering
 system to find out how to process the mail.
</p>

<p>
Spam filtering systems typically add a header such as “X-Spam-Status”
 or “X-Bogosity” to messages in order to indicate which messages are
 spam or even how spammy they are. To check if your mail server tags
 your messages as spam, open one of your messages in Gnus and type C-u
 g (gnus-summary-show-article) to view the complete headers and
 message. If you find a spam-related header such as X-Spam-Status, you
 can use it to split your mail. Add the following to your ~/.gnus:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq spam-use-regex-headers t) ;; (1)
(setq spam-regex-headers-spam "^X-Spam-Status: Yes")   ;; (2)
(require 'spam) ;; (3)
(spam-initialize) ;; (4)
</pre>

<p>
This configures spam.el to detect spam based on message
 headers(1). Set spam-regex-headers-spam to a regular expression
 matching the header your mail server uses to indicate spam.(2) This
 configuration should be done before the spam.el library is loaded(3)
 and initialized(4), because spam.el uses the spam-use-* variables to
 determine which parts of the spam library to load.
</p>

<p>
In order to take advantage of this, you'll also need to add a rule
 that splits spam messages into a different group. If you haven't set
 up mail splitting yet, read qthe instructions on setting up fancy mail
 splitting in “Project XXX: Organize mail into groups”. Add (:
 spam-split) to either nnmail-split-fancy or nnimap-split-fancy,
 depending on your configuration. For example, your ~/.gnus may look
 like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq nnmail-split-fancy
'(
;; ... other split rules go here ...
(: spam-split)
;; ... other split rules go here ...
"mail.misc")) ; default mailbox
</pre>
