<h1 class="title">Choosing a daily schedule in Emacs</h1>

<p>
There's more than one way to plan your day in Emacs, just like there's
 more than one way to do everything in Emacs. The basic end of the
 spectrum includes Diary, Calendar, and Appt. More sophisticated
 modules include Org (part of Emacs 22) and Planner (available
 separately). Then there are Emacs modules to export and import
 calendar data to and from external programs, such as Remind.
</p>

<p>
If all you need to do is keep track of recurring events such as
 birthdays and anniversaries, then Diary can be a good fit for you. All
 it takes is one text file specifying the dates and descriptions of
 one-time or recurring events, and one line in your ~/.emacs file to
 display the diary entries for today whenever you start up. If you
 switch to either Org or Planner later on, you can configure your Emacs
 to include information from your old diary file.
</p>

<p>
If you find yourself wanting more integration with your task list and
 your notes so that you can see everything related to the day, then
 you'll want to go for either Org or Planner. The choice between the
 two depends on how you want to plan your day. &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
If you've worked with a <b>paper-based planner or a typical calendar
application</b>
 for a while, then Planner might be a good fit for the way you think.
 Planner has a strong day orientation. With Planner, you plan your
 schedule in terms of day pages, and optionally cross-reference the
 tasks with project pages. You can keep your schedule as plain text on
 your day page, or you can follow the format suggested by Planner so
 that your scheduled tasks and appointments will be added to Emacs'
 appointment reminder system. Planner is similar to the scheduling
 method of Franklin-Covey day planners and other paper organizers. I
 like Planner because it's easy to scribble notes onto my daily
 schedule, just like I would pencil comments into my paper planner.
</p>

<p>
<b>Org focuses on projects instead of days.</b> With Org, you plan your
 projects first, and then schedule specific tasks or appointments onto
 your calendar. Your daily view is then dynamically generated from the
 headlines of the outline nodes that are scheduled for the day. You
 need to use a special format, but built-in commands make it easy to
 create and edit timestamps. Org has great support for David Allen's
 Getting Things Done (GTD) productivity technique. If you think in
 terms of next actions or outlines, Org is a good fit for you.
</p>

<p>
You can still think in terms of projects with Planner, but you'll need
 to remember to use the built-in commands for editing functions so that
 your changes are also reflected in the day pages. You don't need to
 organize your Org file by project. You can throw everything into one
 outline if you want. However, you'll still need to use the
 dynamically-generated summary view (org-agenda-list) to see your daily
 or weekly schedule, and reading all the text associated with the day
 could mean some jumping around.
</p>

<p>
<b>In short:</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you think in terms of day schedules, start with Planner.
</li>
<li>If you think in terms of projects or outlines, start with Org.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you haven't figured out how your brain works yet, <b>I recommend
 starting with Org.</b> I think that the project-based approach will
 probably help more people out in the long run. I have to admit that I
 love Planner and I've been using it very happily for more than four
 years. I love being able to add all sorts of free-form notes while
 going through the day, and Planner makes it easy to publish that as my
 blog. (Automatically removing all my private notes, of course!) I've
 gotten used to the way Planner works, and because of my extensive
 modifications, Planner's gotten used to the way I work as well. If
 you're starting from scratch, you might like Org's better support for
 projects, outlines, and overviews. Give Org a try first. If you find
 yourself wanting more flexibility in your day view, try Planner next.

<p>
If you've tried both, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the
 differences between them. I'm trying to figure out when one fits
 better than the other because I'm working on a book called “Wicked
 Cool Emacs”. I love Planner, I'm getting the hang of Org, and I'd love
 to hear from other people who have given both a shot. =)
