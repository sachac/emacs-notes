</p>

<p>
Ideas come from everywhere. While reading this blog, you might come
across interesting snippets that you'd like to save. While writing code,
you might be hit by an idea for something you want to do with the
program. While on a phone call, you might need to write down what you
need to prepare for a meeting the next day.
</p>

<p>
How do you take notes now? Do you jot your notes on a scrap of paper or
into a leather notebook? Do you copy and paste what you're looking at
into a plain text file or document? Do you scribble things into a
personal digital assistant?
</p>

<p>
I've tried different note-taking strategies: colorful mindmaps, outlined
text files, even voice recordings. I felt frustrated every time I had to
write down whose e-mail or which webpage prompted the note (shouldn't
the computer do that automatically?), but I was even more frustrated
when I'd come across a note and not remember why I wrote it.
</p>

<p>
Remember changed all that for me. The key ideas behind Remember are that
you should be able to write notes with minimal distraction, and that as
the context should be automatically picked up so that you don't have to
write it down. If you're writing a note based on a mail message,
Remember will pick up the details of the message and create a hyperlink
so that you can view the original message when reviewing your notes. If
you're working on a file, Remember will link to it so that you can jump
back to it. If you're browsing a web page (in Emacs, of course),
Remember will remember the title and URL, so that you can go back to the
page when you want to clarify something in your notes. After you save
the note, you'll be back in the same environment you were: no need to
switch applications and no need to remember different keyboard
shortcuts.
</p>

<p>
You might think that Remember's only worth it if you do \<sub>everything\</sub>_
in Emacs. For me, it worked the other way around. I started by using
Remember to take notes in Planner, a personal information manager
available for Emacs. As I got accustomed to the way Remember and Planner
just automatically hyperlinked to whatever I was looking at, I thought:
Why doesn't my mail client do this? Why doesn't my web browser do this?
Why doesn't my chat client do this? So I ended up reading through the
manuals, figuring out how to do all these things in Emacsâ€”and I loved
it, eventually doing most of my work (and play!) within an Emacs frame.
Although I use other applications now, like Lotus Notes for work mail
and Mozilla Firefox for browsing, I still switch back to Emacs for my
notes.
</p>

<p>
In this section, you'll learn how to set up Remember and take quick
notes in Emacs. We'll start by configuring Remember to save your notes
to a file, and how to configure Remember to save to different places
depending on the content. You'll also learn how to quickly search your
notes file for entries.
</p>

<p>
You can also integrate Remember into other note-taking systems in Emacs.
The sections that cover those systems will also show you how to
configure Remember to save your notes there.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Setting Up Remember</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Remember is a separate package, which you can download from
<a href="https://gna.org/projects/remember-el"><a href="https://gna.org/projects/remember-el">https://gna.org/projects/remember-el</a></a>
. As of this writing, the latest stable release is Remember 1.9.
Download the latest version and unpack it into your ~/elisp directory.
You should end up with a new directory, ~/elisp/remember-1.9 .
</p>

<p>
To configure Remember to save to plain text files, add this code to your
~/.emacs and evaluate it:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/remember-1.9") ;; (1)
(require 'remember-autoloads)
(setq remember-data-file "~/notes.txt")  ;; (2)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c r") 'remember) ;; (3)

(defun wicked/remember-review-file ()
 "Open `remember-data-file'."
 (interactive)
 (find-file-other-window remember-data-file))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c R") 'wicked/remember-review-file) ;; (4)
</pre>

<pre class="example">
;; Not (global-set-key (kbd "C-c r")... as originally written... Thanks for catching that, Seth!
</pre>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1: Change this to the directory that contains remember.el
</li>
<li>2: Notes will be saved to this file. You can change this if you want;
just keep in mind that this section refers to ~/notes.txt.
</li>
<li>3: C-c r (remember) is a handy shortcut key for remember. You can
also bind it to other shortcut keys such as F9 r.
</li>
<li>4: This shortcut makes it easy to check your remembered notes.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
After you've configured Remember, try it out by typing C-c r (remember).
Your Emacs frame will be split in two, and one of the windows will be a
<b>Remember</b> buffer. Type your note. The first line will be the headline,
and the rest of the buffer will be the body of the note. If you call C-c
r (remember) from a file, the filename will automatically be included at
the end of the buffer. Type C-c C-c (remember-buffer) to save the note.
</p>

<p>
Try it now by typing C-c r (remember) to bring up the buffer, typing in
a short note, and using C-c c (remember-buffer) to save it. If you open
~/notes.txt to review your note, you'll find something like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
** Sat Jan 12 14:43:02 2008 (Your headline goes here)

Your note body goes here

/home/sacha/.emacs
</pre>

<p>
You can even save yourself some copying and pasting. Mark a region of
text and use C-u C-c r (remember). The selected text will be included in
the buffer, so all you have to do is comment on it.
</p>

<p>
Make a habit of typing C-c C-r or C-u C-c C-r (remember) when you need
to remember something. Type C-c C-c (remember-buffer) to get back to
work, knowing that your notes have been safely saved in your ~/notes.txt
file.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Reviewing Your Notes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Use C-c R (wicked/remember-review-file) to check your notes, or open
~/notes.txt yourself.
 To search your notes, use C-c R (wicked/remember-review-file) to open
the file, then use C-s (isearch-forward) to search for words
interactively, or use M-x occur to find all lines containing a word.
</p>

<p>
You may notice that the default format that Remember uses is an outline
format that is compatible with Org and Allout, both of which have
powerful outline-editing tools. I prefer Org's outline-editing commands,
and you'll learn about them in the “Outline Notes with Org” section.
Here's a quick summary.
</p>

<p>
First, you need to switch the buffer to Org mode by typing M-x org-mode.
To automatically open your notes file in Org mode, add
</p>

<pre class="example">
-*- mode: org -*-
</pre>

<p>
to the first line of your ~/notes.txt. Then, when you open your
~/notes.txt file, it will be in Org mode.
</p>

<p>
You can quickly collapse or expand all the outline entries by pressing
S-TAB (org-shifttab). To collapse or expand a single entry, move the
point to the headline (the line beginning with *, **, or any number of
asterisks), then press TAB (org-cycle). To move an entry up or down,
move the point to the headline and press S-UP (org-shiftup) or S-DOWN
(org-shiftdown). To demote or promote a heading, press M-RIGHT
(org-metaright) or M-LEFT (org-metaleft).
</p>

<p>
You can treat ~/notes.txt as your inbox, and keep your organized notes
in another file or groups of files. Cut and paste the text between the
files to clear your inbox, and use M-x grep to search multiple files.
Alternatively, you can keep all of your notes in one large text file,
and use C-s (isearch-forward) and M-x occur to search for information.
</p>

<p>
Now you know the basics of remembering information, saving it into a
file, and reviewing the file. By default, Remember annotates your notes
with a filename, if you were looking at a file when you called C-c r
(remember). As you learn more about Emacs, you may want to configure
Remember to add more intelligent annotations and other text to the
Remember buffer. The more work Remember does for you, the less work you
have to do!
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Enabling annotation functions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The easiest way to get Remember to automatically understand mail
messages, Web pages, info files, BBDB contact records, and other sources
of information in Emacs is to use either Org or Planner. To learn how to
integrate Remember with either Org or Planner, read the section on
“Outline Your Notes with Org” and “Writing Your Journal with Planner”.
</p>

<p>
You can also define your own annotation functions. When you call C-c r
(remember) from a buffer, Remember goes through each of the functions in
remember-annotation-functions, and it uses the first non-nil value
returned.
</p>

<p>
For example, you may work with many temporary buffers that don't have
filenames. To create an annotation function that adds buffer names, add
the following code to your ~/.emacs after the basic Remember
configuration code:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(eval-after-load 'remember
  '(progn
    (add-to-list 'remember-annotation-functions 'buffer-name t)))
</pre>

<p>
This adds buffer-name to the end of the annotation list, making it a
last resort.
</p>

<p>
What if you want line numbers included with the filename or buffer name?
You could replace the previous code with this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun wicked/remember-line-numbers-and-file-names ()
 "Return FILENAME line NUMBER."
 (save-restriction
  (widen)
   (format " %s line %d"
    (or (buffer-file-name) (buffer-name))
    (line-number-at-pos))))
(eval-after-load 'remember
  '(progn
     (add-to-list 'remember-annotation-functions
                  'wicked/remember-line-numbers-and-file-names)))
</pre>

<p>
With that code, C-c r (remember) will automatically pick up the line
number from your file or buffer.
</p>

<p>
By default, Remember saves your notes to a plain-text file, so you'll
have to open the files manually. The command M-x ffap or
find-find-file-at-point may be convenient. If you want hyperlinks that
you can visit easily, consider saving your notes in an Org or Planner
file instead.
</p>

<p>
Now you've got context. What else can you do with the Remember buffer?
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Adding Other Text to the Remember Buffer</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Remember has plenty of hooks that let you modify the behavior. For
example, you might want to insert a random tagline or fortune-cookie
saying whenever you create a note. This is a fun way to encourage
yourself to write more, because then there's a little surprise every
time you open a Remember buffer.
</p>

<p>
Here is a totally small-scale way to use random lines from a text file.
Let's say that you have a text file made up of movie quotes, taglines,
knock-knock jokes, or short fortune-cookie sayings. When I wrote this
code, I used Japanese/English sentence pairs about cats, because I was
studying Japanese. You can use whatever tickles your fancy, as long as
this text file (~/taglines.txt) has one line per saying.
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun wicked/random-tagline (&amp;optional file)
  "Return a random tagline."
  (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect (or file "~/taglines.txt"))
    (goto-char (random (point-max)))
    (let ((string
           (buffer-substring (line-beginning-position)
                             (line-end-position))))
      string)))

(eval-after-load 'remember
  '(progn
     (defadvice remember (after wicked activate)
       "Add random tagline."
       (save-excursion
         (goto-char (point-max))
         (insert "\n\n" (wicked/random-tagline) "\n\n")))))
</pre>

<p>
If you want multi-line sayings, look into the Emacs fortune cookie
package, and replace wicked/random-tagline with a function that returns
a random string.
</p>

<p>
This code modifies the behavior of C-c r (remember) by inserting a
random tagline after the buffer has been prepared. You can use the same
idea to insert a timestamp noting the time you started, use a template,
or modify the text in other ways.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Saving to Different Places</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
You can also change how Remember saves its notes. For example, if you
want all of the notes that contain the word “:EMACS:” or “:WORK:” to go
into separate files, you can add this code to your ~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defvar wicked/remember-keywords
  '((":EMACS:" . "~/emacs.txt")
    (":WORK:" . "~/work.txt"))
  "*List of (REGEXP . FILENAME).
If an entry matches REGEXP, it will be storied in FILENAME.
The first regular expression that matches is used.")
(eval-after-load 'remember
  '(progn
     (defadvice remember-region (around wicked activate)
       "Save notes matching `wicked/remember-keywords' elsewhere."
       (let* ((b (or beg (min (point) (or (mark) (point-min)))))
          (e (or end (max (point) (or (mark) (point-max)))))
          (string (buffer-substring-no-properties b e))
          (done nil)
          (keywords wicked/remember-keywords))
     (while keywords
       (when (string-match (caar keywords) string)
         (let ((remember-data-file (cdar keywords)))
           ad-do-it)
         (setq keywords nil done t))
       (setq keywords (cdr keywords)))
     (unless done
       ad-do-it)))))
</pre>

<p>
You can even configure Remember to use different handler functions. This
chapter covers several note-taking systems for Emacs, and you may want
to use Remember to save to more than one note-taking system. For
example, you can set up C-c r p to start a Remember buffer that saves to
Planner, and C-c r o to start a Remember buffer that saves to Org.
Here's the code for your ~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun wicked/remember-to-org ()
  "Remember to Org."
  (let ((remember-annotation-functions   ;; (1)
     (cons 'org-remember-annotation
           remember-annotation-functions)))
    (remember)
    (set (make-variable-buffer-local
      'remember-handler-functions)
     '(org-remember-handler))))      ;; (2)

(defun wicked/remember-to-planner ()
  "Remember to Planner."
  (let ((remember-annotation-functions   ;; (3)
     (append planner-annotation-functions
         remember-annotation-functions)))
    (remember)
    (set (make-variable-buffer-local
      'remember-handler-functions)
     '(remember-planner-append))))      ;; (4)

(global-unset-key (kbd "C-c r"))  ;; (5)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c r o") 'wicked/remember-to-org)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c r p") 'wicked/remember-to-planner)
</pre>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1: We need to make sure that Org-compatible links are created.
</li>
<li>2: This makes C-c C-c save the note to the Org file.
</li>
<li>3: Planner uses a list of annotation functions, so we add all of them
to the beginning of the list.
</li>
<li>4: This makes C-c C-c save the note to the Planner page.
</li>
<li>5: We need to unset keyboard shortcuts before we can set longer
keyboard shortcuts that start with the same sequence.
</li>
</ul>

systems, read the sections for those systems.
