<h1 class="title">Emacs: sorting contacts by timestamp</h1>
<p>
September 7th, 2007 -

</p>

<p>
Last September, I started automatically tracking my e-mails. Every
 time I sent a message to someone already in my addressbook, his or her
 contact record would be updated with the date and subject of the
 message. I also made it easy to note that I met someone in person or
 that I talked to them on the phone, although this wasn't automatic.
</p>

<p>
So now I have almost a year of contact information in my address book.
 I was curious&#x2014;whom haven't I talked to in a year?
</p>

<p>
Here are some numbers:
</p>

<p>
I've contacted 396 people in my addressbook since January 1, 2007.
</p>

<p>
In the past 365 days (2006.09.07 &#x2013; 2007.09.07), I've contacted 670
 people in my address book.
</p>

<p>
93 people have a contact timestamp (maybe the day I met them), but I
 haven't contacted them in the past 365 days. This breaks down to 37
 people I haven't contacted since 2006, 32 people I haven't contacted
 since 2005, and 24 from 2004 or earlier.
</p>

<p>
1230 records do not have any contact timestamp. Some of these are
 bots, some of these are duplicate records I still haven't gotten
 around to merging, others are contacts from before I started tracking
 and I haven't e-mailed or talked to them since.
</p>

<p>
I figured this out by writing a bit of Emacs Lisp to print a
 hyperlinked list of contacts with the date of last contact. This was
 then very easy to sort using M-x sort-lines and M-x reverse-region.
</p>

<p>
For example, here are the people I've e-mailed in the last seven days:

The code below probably won't work out of the box with you unless
 you're using Planner+BBDB+my mail tracking hacks, but maybe it'll give
 you ideas.
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun sacha/bbdb-print-with-timestamp (records)
  (while records
    (insert (sacha/bbdb-last-timestamp (car records))
            " |\t"
            (or (sacha/planner-bbdb-annotation-from-bbdb records) "")
            "\n")
    (setq records (cdr records))))

;; (assert (equal (sacha/extract-regexp "a." "ab ac bb") '("ab" "ac")))
(defun sacha/extract-regexp (regexp string &amp;optional group)
  (let (result
        s
        (start 0))
    (while (string-match regexp string start)
      (setq result (cons (match-string (or group 0) string) result))
      (setq start (match-end 0)))
    (nreverse result)))

(defun sacha/bbdb-timestamps (rec)
  "Return a list of timestamps found in the notes or contact field of REC."
  (sort
   (sacha/extract-regexp planner-date-regexp
                         (concat (or (bbdb-record-notes rec) "")
                                 " "
                                 (bbdb-record-getprop rec 'contact)))
   (lambda (a b) (string&lt; b a))))

(defun sacha/bbdb-last-timestamp (rec)
  "Return the most recent timestamp for REC or nil if none."
  (or (car (sacha/bbdb-timestamps rec)) "0000.00.00"))
</pre>

<p>
Yes, I do weird things. Next step for this one: Review the list, see
 who I haven't talked to in one year, and decide who I want to get back
 in touch with. Also, analyze my e-mail and come up with pretty graphs.
