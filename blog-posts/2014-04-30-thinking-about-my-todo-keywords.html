</p>

<p>
It's been twelve years since David Allen published Getting Things Done,
with its geek-friendly flowcharts and processes for handling tasks in an
interrupt-driven life. The way I manage my tasks is heavily influenced
by GTD. I think in terms of next actions, waiting, and someday, and I
have weekly reviews. I modified the TODO states a little to reflect what
I need. It's time to think about those states again to see what I can
tweak and what reports I could use.
</p>

<p>
I use Org Mode in Emacs to manage my tasks and my notes. I can customize
it to give me different kinds of reports, such as showing me all of my
unscheduled tasks, or all tasks with a specific category, or even
projects that are “stuck” (no next actions defined). Thinking about my
processes will help me figure out what reports I want and how I want to
use them.
</p>

<p>
Here are different types of tasks and how I track them:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Things I can work on right now (next actions): <code>TODO</code>
</li>
<li>Things that I can work on after a different task is finished:
currently <code>WAITING</code>, but probably better to implement with org-depend
</li>
<li>Things I will revisit at a certain date, but I don't need to think
about them until then: <code>TODO</code>, scheduled (I used to use <code>POSTPONED</code>)
</li>
<li>Things that would be nice to do someday, but maybe are incompletely
specified or understood: <code>SOMEDAY</code>
</li>
<li>Things I have decided not to work on: <code>CANCELLED</code>
</li>
<li>Things I have asked someone else to do: <code>DELEGATED</code>
</li>
<li>Things I can ask someone else to do: <code>TODELEGATE</code>
</li>
<li>Things I am waiting for (usually not based on date) and that I need
to follow up on: <code>WAITING</code>
</li>
<li>Things I can write about: <code>TOBLOG</code>. These are pretty optional, so I
don't want them in my TODO list&#x2026;
</li>
<li>If something is a duplicate of something else &#x2013; remove TODO keyword
and add link?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I use the following code for an agenda view of unscheduled tasks:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-org">(defun sacha/org-agenda-skip-scheduled ()
  (org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled 'deadline 'regexp "\n]+&gt;"))

(add-to-list 'org-agenda-custom-commands
   '("u" "Unscheduled tasks" alltodo ""
     ((org-agenda-skip-function 'sacha/org-agenda-skip-scheduled)
     (org-agenda-overriding-header "Unscheduled TODO entries: "))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So the to-do process looks like this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every week, review my <a href="http://sachachua.com/evil-plans">evil plans</a>
and projects. Check my agenda without the routine tasks to see what
new things I'm working on. Schedule a few tasks to encourage me to
make regular progress.
</li>
<li>Every day, go through my Org agenda (<code>C-c a a</code>) and do all the tasks
that are scheduled.
</li>
<li>When I'm done or if I feel like working on something else:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What do I feel like doing? If there's a specific activity that I
feel like:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Go to the relevant project/section of my TODO list, or check
the TODOs by context (drawing, writing, etc.)
</li>
<li>Clock in on that task.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there's a specific task I feel like working on:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Find the task, maybe with <code>C-u C-c C-w</code> (<code>org-refile</code>) and work
on it.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there's a new idea I want to work on:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use <code>org-capture</code> to create the task, file it in the
appropriate project, and then clock in.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If I have an idea for a task, use <code>org-capture</code> to create the task
and file it in the appropriate project.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
How do I want to improve this?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Maybe get more used to working with contexts?</b> I have all these Org
Agenda commands and I hardly ever use them. I tend to work with
projects instead. Actually, working with projects makes sense too,
because that minimizes the real context shift.
</li>
<li><b>Get better at reviewing existing tasks.</b> I started tracking the
number of tasks in each state (DONE, TODO, etc.), which nudged me to
review the tasks and cross old tasks off. If I streamline my process
for capturing tasks, filing them, and reviewing them by
project/context/effort, then I can get better at choosing good tasks
to work on from my existing TODO list.
</li>
<li><b>Estimate effort for more tasks, and use that more often</b> I have some
reports that can filter or sort by estimated effort. I don't use
effort that much, though. Does it makes sense to get into the habit
of choosing tasks by estimated time as an alternative approach? I
usually have fairly large, flexible blocks of time&#x2026;
</li>
<li><b>Tag things by level of energy required?</b>
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/11/high-energy-and-low-energy-activities/">I want to take advantage of high-energy times.</a> So, when I feel alert
and creative, I want to focus on coding and writing. I can save
things like paperwork for low-energy times. I can tag some tasks as
<p>
:lowenergy: and then filter my reports.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hmm&#x2026;
