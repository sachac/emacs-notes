Like almost all newbies, I started out with pico, the editor that
 comes with pine. pico was friendly. pico was easy to use. pico also
 kept wrapping my lines, which is a Very Bad Idea when you're
 programming. I discovered that <code>pico -w</code> would turn such
 undesirable behavior off, and <code>alias pico</code>"pico -w "=
 became part of my .bashrc everywhere.
</p>

<p>
However, I felt mildly ashamed of pico. All the Unix books said I
 should learn how to use vi, so I did. vi was fun, too &#x2013; vim,
 especially. I had my funky one-line ex commands, like :s%/foo/bar/g. I
 could go to any line with :linenumber. I regularly used :! to invoke
 shell commands. I liked the way it syntax-colored practically all the
 files I edited &#x2013; even the more obscure ones &#x2013; and I was even thinking
 of writing my own syntax files for the things it didn't handle yet.
</p>

<p>
I suppose it was sheer curiosity that made me try out Emacs. Emacs was
 an intellectual challenge. I found myself attracted to its
 intimidating complexity. I wanted to see if I could get the hang of it.
</p>

<p>
Emacs was surprisingly easy to use. I read through the tutorial. I
 even browsed through the info node in my spare time. I used the menu
 bar and the tool bar until I learned the different shortcuts and
 extended commands. It was pretty cool.
</p>

<p>
Then one summer, I opened the Emacs LISP intro manual. I got hooked.
 I started reading Emacs source code. I traced through functions. I
 wrote my own. I did more and more stuff in Emacs and I realized how
 much I had missed by using other editors.
</p>

<p>
Emacs is cool. =)
