I fell in love with Emacs because of Planner and Remember. I got hooked.
By that, I mean that I discovered the joys of modifying the behavior of
other people's code through hooks. Well-written Emacs code has plenty of
entry points so that you can change things without rewriting everything,
and both Planner and Remember were well-written. The flexibility that
John Wiegley had built into Planner and Remember (in his spare time!)
convinced me that I absolutely needed to learn Emacs Lisp. I e-mailed
John, singing high praises about Planner and volunteering to help track
down any bug reports so that I could learn in the process of helping
others.
</p>

<p>
What did he do? He made me the maintainer for Planner, the go-to person,
the buck-stops-here person. Was I terrified? My first time being in
charge of an open source project, a language that I had just begun to
learn, and schoolwork to do on top of all of that&#x2026; Of course I was
scared. I found a way to make working on Planner part of my final-year
project (might as well get academic credit for hacking on it!), made the
Emacs Lisp Intro and the Emacs Lisp manuals my weekend, bedtime, and
mealtime reading. Back then, Planner.el was one file, which made it a
little less intimidating.
</p>

<p>
At first, I found it hard to think of a way to improve Planner, which
was already a great way to track my tasks. Remember was also a good way
to jot down short notes that were automatically added to my Planner day
page. Both Planner and Remember had some support for picking up
hyperlinks to whatever I was looking at when I created the task or note.
What was missing? Timestamps so that I could tell when I wrote a note;
more link support so that I could automatically link to a file or a mail
message or a contact record; private, perhaps even encrypted segments;
copying a note to another page; publishing a blog as RSS&#x2026; For the next
few years, I worked with incredible people who had thought
 long and hard about how they managed their tasks and their notes, and
 who taught me how they did things through their feature requests and
 their code. I became more comfortable in Emacs Lisp than in any other
computer language I knew (eventually maintaining Remember as well), I
had formed a thriving community of about 200 people around the world who
also contributed ideas and code, and I was hooked.

Because I could change so much about Emacs, I had so much <i>fun</i>
 coming up with creative applications. When a friend and I
 were studying Japanese, she wanted to know if I could set up Emacs with
 flashcards and example sentences so that we could learn words in
 context. I knew that Jim Breen had a huge database of example Japanese
 sentences with their English translations and that this was freely
 available on the Net. I downloaded the database and&#x2013;one crazy idea
 fueled by another in that natural sugar high that can happen when two
 geeks start brainstorming&#x2013;I made our learning <i>fun</i> by
 extracting all the cat- and kitten-related sentences. This is how I
 learned about such wonderfully onomatopeic words as “fuwafuwashita”,
 which means “fluffy”. We both adored cute little kitties, and reading
 example sentences about these furballs would make our studies
 delightful. Now, where could we put these sentences so that we'd run
 into them often? Aha! Remember! Every time we wrote a blog post or
 needed a scratch pad to store some information, we would be rewarded by
a
 short sentence in Japanese about cute little kittens, and we could look
 up the meaning and pronunciation with custom keyboard shortcuts. And
 hey, it worked for me&#x2013;I found myself writing because I wanted to see
 what sentence would come up, and I found myself learning because I'd
 run into all these cool words. For variety, I switched to sentences
 about computers and other topics that I wanted to be able to discuss.
 Try getting <i>your</i> blog editor or note manager to reward you each time
you share a story or write down a tidbit of information. There is
incredible power in customizing your note-taking system to just the way
you think, and when you combine that with the delight of a surprise, you
have something that is difficult to do with any other
system&#x2013;paper-based or electronic, text-based or graphical, commercial
or free.
</p>

<p>
I turned the projects over to other maintainers when I started with
graduate school, but as you can see, I still love working with Emacs. My
mind does this little somersault of joy when I pull off a particularly
nifty tweak or when I run across a beautiful piece of code. And yes, one
of the reasons why I'm writing this book about Emacs is because I'd love
to have an opportunity to explore all the nooks and crevices of this
piece of software&#x2013;well, not all, because by the time the book hits
press, people will have added even more.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter on notetaking, I hope to be able to show you the
mechanics of note-taking in Emacs&#x2013;but more than that, I hope to show
the sheer <i>joy</i> of having a system that you can play with, of not just
filing notes in a database but M-x remember-ing in a system that will
make you smile or laugh, of shaping and reshaping things until they fit
you like clay fits your hand. Come and have fun.
