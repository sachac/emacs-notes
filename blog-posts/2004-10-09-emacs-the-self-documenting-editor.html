In response to cmarguel's blog entry:
</p>

<p>
Miguel Arguelles wondered what was so self-documenting about Emacs.
 Paolo showed him the source code, but Miguel pointed out people have
 to type those comments in anyway. So what makes Emacs a
 self-documenting editor and my favorite tool?
</p>

<p>
Emacs is called a self-documenting editor because the source code to
 \<sub>any\</sub>_ function can be found with a few keystrokes. Curious about how
 M-x find-file works? Use C-h f to look up the definition, follow the
 link in the help buffer, and get as much detail as you want. You can
 even use the Emacs debugger (edebug) to explore the behavior of
 functions. Emacs exposes its internals to an extent no other editor
 has even attempted.
</p>

<p>
Code? Why are we looking at code? Shouldn't we be looking at neat
 comments explaining how everything works? The paradigm shift here is
 that \<sub>code\</sub>_ is often the best documentation for itself. Comments
 should explain usage and the background reasons for coding, but the
 code itself should be clear and easy to understand. Programming
 languages like C and Java tend to encourage short, almost cryptic
 identifiers. Lisp may initially seem daunting because of the
 parentheses, but the long identifier names and the simple structure
 make it easy to read even if you don't have a background in functional
 programming.
</p>

<p>
Not only can you look functions up, but you can also \<sub>change\</sub>_ them
 while Emacs is running. Don't like the way save-buffer works? You can
 redefine it with a little Emacs Lisp programming. Want to do some pre-
 or post-processing? There's support for that too. Emacs is a rapid
 development environment for itself. That's why there are so many
 modules available for it. Emacs is an editor you can customize to your
 heart's content.
</p>

<p>
Documentation is just a few keystrokes away. All the commonly-used
 functions and variables have clear instructions for usage. Emacs
 coding style suggests having a documentation string explaining the
 arguments and usage for each function, and there are tools for
 checking compliance. Emacs also has a lot of contributed documentation
 on <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org"><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org">http://www.emacswiki.org</a></a> and other
Emacs-related sites.
</p>

<p>
Emacs doesn't hide anything from you. That's why Emacs is called a
 self-documenting editor. Even after trying out other editors like
 Eclipse and vim, I still go back to Emacs. I've tasted power, and I'm
 hooked.
