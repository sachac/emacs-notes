<p>
<a href="https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog">Org2Blog</a> is an awesome
geek-friendly way of writing posts and publishing them to a
WordPress-based blog. When <a href="http://christopherolah.com">Christopher
Olah</a> told me that he'd gotten convinced to try Org Mode thanks to the
enthusiastic recommendations from
<a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/michael-a-nielsen/">Michael Nielsen</a>
and me, we figured that getting him sorted out with taking notes in Org
and publishing them through Org2Blog to his WordPress.com-hosted blog
would be an excellent way to start &#x2013; especially with inline images and
LaTeX.
</p>

<p>
Chris has promised to write a blog post about what he's learned, but
he'll probably find these notes useful. Here's what we ran into when
getting org2blog working on Ubuntu.
</p>

<p>
<b>Need to install the files and set up the load paths</b>
</p>

<p>
We downloaded the following and added them to an <code>~/.elisp</code> directory
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog"><a href="https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog">https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog</a></a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/punchagan/metaweblog.el"><a href="https://github.com/punchagan/metaweblog.el">https://github.com/punchagan/metaweblog.el</a></a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://launchpad.net/xml-rpc-el"><a href="https://launchpad.net/xml-rpc-el">https://launchpad.net/xml-rpc-el</a></a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We also set up his <code>~/.init.d/emacs.el</code> to load the libraries, set the
blog list, and load <code>ido-mode</code> and <code>icomplete-mode</code>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Emacs / Org too old</b>
</p>

<p>
Metaweblog and Org2blog didn't work well with Emacs 23 and Org 6. We
upgraded to Emacs 24 with <code>apt-get install emacs24</code> in order to get Org
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li></li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Can't find library org</b>
</p>

<p>
It turns out that you also need to <code>apt-get install emacs24-el</code> in order
to include those libraries.
</p>

<p>
<b>Org still too old for org2blog</b>
</p>

<p>
We were having some problems with the version detection of org2blog, so
we replaced the org2blog he downloaded with the version I forked at
<a href="https://github.com/sachac/org2blog"><a href="https://github.com/sachac/org2blog">https://github.com/sachac/org2blog</a></a>
, which I've been using with Org 7.
</p>

<p>
Then we tested it with <code>org2blog/wp-post-subtree</code>, and that worked.
Inline images with <code>org-toggle-inline-images</code> worked too, yay!
</p>

<p>
Next step: viewing LaTeX fragments, since Chris does a lot of math.
</p>

<p>
<b>dvipng required</b>
</p>

<p>
<code>org-preview-latex-fragment</code> wanted dvipng to be installed, so we
<code>apt-get install dvipng</code>.
</p>

<p>
<b>LaTeX fragment preview showed blank images</b>
</p>

<p>
We looked at the <code>*Messages*</code> buffer and found that the <code>.tex</code> files in
<code>/tmp</code> could not be rendered by <code>dvipng</code> because <code>marvosym.sty</code> could
not be found. We fixed that with
<code>apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended.</code>
</p>

<p>
(Doing this on my own, I found that I also needed
<code>apt-get install texlive-latex-extra</code> .)
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; and then we could see <b>and publish</b> LaTeX fragments, which was
awesome. =D
</p>

<p>
<b>WordPress.com double-interpreted LaTeX fragments</b>
</p>

<p>
Chris was having problems with LaTeX fragments when
<code>org-export-with-LaTeX-fragments</code> was set to dvipng. It turns out that
WordPress.com also interprets LaTeX, so it was getting confused by the
alt tags. To solve this, use M-x customize
org-export-with-LaTeX-fragmentsand choose <code>Leave math verbatim</code>. Then
the LaTeX fragments are passed to WordPress, which renders them as PNGs.
</p>

<p>
Hope that helps!
