<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/2610"><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/2610">http://sachachua.com/blog/p/2610</a></a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://journal.houseonahill.net/index.php/journal/entry/3781">sassylawyer
has been plagiarized</a>. That got me to
 thinking about plagiarism, and you know? I don't think I've ever been
 badly plagiarized. Probably not a single line maliciously lifted from
my <a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/Ph104">Ph104</a> or
 <a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/JapanTraining">JapanTraining</a>
notes.
 No one reposts me to get +5 Insightful or to increase post count on
 some bulletin board. I saw a number of Google queries poking around my
 <a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/">notebook</a> directory back when I
still had files from college,
 but those were probably people who would've copied netlists or
 programs from elsewhere on the Net, anyway.
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: I must be really boring. ;)
</p>

<p>
I suppose it also helps that the only things I post on my blog are
 <a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/EmacsHacks">random code
snippets</a>, <a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/ShortStories">bad short
stories</a>, <a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/2005.01.28#5">business
ideas</a>,
 and my TODO list, all of which can be freely reposted anywhere you
want.
 (In fact, please steal my TODO list!)
</p>

<p>
The only people who read my blog are geeks, my family and my friends.
 They're all smarter than I am and have no problems coming up with
 insightful posts on their own.
</p>

<p>
I'm not concerned about plagiarism. I trust that if my thoughts are
 being posted to a forum by someone who's too lazy to think up cool
 stuff, the mere fact that the poster would think other people would
 find such things interesting means that some of the readers might've
 stumbled across my blog before. Then they laugh at the poster,
 completely destroying the poster's reputation. Mwahaha.
</p>

<p>
Even if I never get attributed, it's nice that the ideas are out
 there. My ideas are more important than my byline. I don't care who
 eventually makes stuff happen as long as the stuff happens. I learn by
 writing, and I lose nothing if people copy me. If people go to the
 trouble of stripping out my identity, then they'll just have to deal
 with questions and bugs themselves.
</p>

<p>
I don't care if people stumbling upon my work never bother to find out
 who I am. If they find something in my braindump useful, well and
 good. If they copy-and-paste what I've written into something they
 need to submit for class or work, they've lost the opportunity to
 exercise their mind.
</p>

<p>
If someone ever accuses me of plagiarizing my own work, I'll simply
 laugh and point to the other stuff I've written or to the things I've
 done. People know I'm real.
</p>

<p>
So there. I trust you, reader. I'll never use Javascript hacks to make
 it difficult for you to save data from my website.
 I'll never make it difficult for you to syndicate my blog
 (<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/sachac">RSS feed</a>) or copy it
 whole-sale. Heck, if you want
 an archive of my planner, either wget -r
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/plans/"><a href="http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/plans/">http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/plans/</a></a>
or e-mail me for an archive.
</p>

<p>
Go ahead and steal my thoughts. Add your insights. Make them better.
