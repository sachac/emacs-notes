<p>
“Human factors of personal web information spaces” is a detailed
 statistical study of how people use bookmarks, including observations
 on filing and navigation patterns.
</p>

<p>
Many of the issues raised in the paper have been addressed by recent
 innovations in bookmarking. For example, browser-based bookmarks allow
 you to automatically check if pages have changed or disappeared. The
 flat tag-based organization of services such as
<a href="http://del.icio.us"><a href="http://del.icio.us">http://del.icio.us</a></a>
 reduce much of the cognitive load of organizing projects.
 <a href="http://del.icio.us"><a href="http://del.icio.us">http://del.icio.us</a></a> also offers a chronological
view of bookmarks.
</p>

<p>
This paper made me think about organizational strategies for
 categorized tasks. Tasks in Planner and other PIMs that allow you to
 directly hyperlink to resources (Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft
 Outlook) act as bookmarks, creating a personal information space
 annotated by the things you need to do.
</p>

<p>
Task- and schedule-related personal information suffers from many of
 the same problems as the World Wide Web. Information overload comes in
 the form of e-mail about tasks and appointments. The inbox is polluted
 by irrelevant messages. Task- and schedule-related information tends
 to be less chaotic than the Web because the former is personal by
 nature, but it still lacks aggregate structure and a global view.
</p>

<p>
This paper makes me want to look into the organizational strategies of
 PIM users. For example, how do people categorize their tasks?
 Creation-time filing or sporadic filing? How do they choose
 categories? How do they deal with long task lists? Do they really
 reorder tasks for priorities, or just scan through them and pick
 items? Can I characterize PIM users by scale, like the way Abrams
 describes light to heavy bookmark users, citing characteristic
 strategies?
