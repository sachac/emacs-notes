<h1 class="title">Generating a table of projects and their actions</h1>
<p>
November 1st, 2007 -
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/4429"><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/4429">http://sachachua.com/blog/p/4429</a></a>
</p>

<p>
Here's how I generated my list of
<a href="http://sachachua.com/101goals.html">101 short-term goals</a>.
</p>

<p>
First, I brainstormed the list of goals in an org-mode file. Each goal
 is represented by a level-2 outline heading. Current projects are
 tagged :PROJECT:. The goals are grouped under level-1 outline
 headings, like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Reading, Writing, and Sharing
** 30. Write and publish a 350-page book about Emacs :PROJECT:
</pre>

<p>
Then I went through all of the goals and added next actions to each of
them.
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Reading, Writing, and Sharing
** 30. Write and publish a 350-page book about Emacs :PROJECT:
*** TODO 30min Write another blog post about Emacs.
</pre>

<p>
This made it easy to keep track of my finished tasks. Whenever I
 finished a next action, I'd mark a task as DONE and create another
 task in the same project. (Hey, I can automate that bit&#x2026;)
</p>

<p>
To generate the list of next actions for projects without including
 the finished tasks, I used C-c C-v (org-show-todo-tree). I found that
 command by typing M-x org-show- and letting icomplete-mode show me the
 possible functions.
</p>

<p>
Then I exported the visible tree to a temporary buffer with C-c C-e v
 SPC (org-export, visible, keep buffer). I used re-builder to test a
 regular expression that combined the project headline with the task
 headline. I then copied the regular expression into a short Lisp
 program that replaced all the matching lines with the table row. I
 then exported this with C-c C-e H (org-export, HTML to buffer) and
 edited the page a little before saving it to a file.
</p>

<p>
This ability to quickly parse and massage the data into the form I
 want is one of the things that I love about Emacs. =)
