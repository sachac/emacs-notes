<p>
September 30th, 2013 -
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/26050"><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/26050">http://sachachua.com/blog/p/26050</a></a>
</p>

<p>
I've been thinking about
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/08/thinking-about-how-to-type-faster/">how
to type faster than 110wpm</a>, and digging into the specific factors that
I could improve. In particular, I wanted to get a sense of:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>my theoretical top speed
</li>
<li>whether alternates or rolls are better for me
</li>
<li>how quickly I can twitch, measured by single-key repeats or two-key
alternations
</li>
</ul>


<div class="figure">
<p><a href="uploads/2013/09/shutterstock_145785482.jpg"><img src="uploads/2013/09/shutterstock_145785482_thumb.jpg" alt="shutterstock_145785482_thumb.jpg" /></a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
By using totally artificial typing tests (ex: type “thththth&#x2026;”)
instead of word-based ones, I can explore the relationships between
character combinations and speed without worrying about hitting SPC,
sounding out words, correcting errors, and so on. Since I can do the
tests in short sprints, I can rest enough in between to minimize my risk
of RSI.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Using Emacs to test my raw typing speed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I haven't come across an online typing test that gives the kind of stats
I want, or even a per-character or digram breakdown. I thought about
writing a Javascript-based typing timer, but I figured it would be less
work to cajole Emacs into measuring what I wanted. Here's the code:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun sacha/timer-go ()
  "Quick keyboard timer."
  (interactive)
  (insert "GO\n")
  (run-with-timer 3 nil (lambda () (insert "\n")))  ; for warmup
  (run-with-timer 15 nil (lambda () ; 12 seconds + the 3-second warmup
                           (let ((col (- (point) (line-beginning-position))))
                             (insert (format " | %d | \n" col)))
                           )))
(local-set-key (kbd "&lt;f7&gt;") 'sacha/timer-go)
</pre>

<p>
This prints “GO” to show you that it's running. You have three seconds
to warm up, so you don't have to worry about wasting any milliseconds
after <code>M-x sacha/timer-go</code> (or <code>F7</code>, the keyboard shortcut I bound mine
to). After the warmup, Emacs adds a newline and the “race” is on.
There's a 12 second period of actual typing, and then Emacs adds the
number of characters you typed. When you see that, you can stop.
</p>

<p>
Twelve seconds is a useful number for estimating typing speed because
the conversion from characters per minute (CPM) to words per minute
(WPM) usually uses a factor of 5: CPM / 5 = WPM. So the number of
characters you can type in <code>60 seconds / 5</code> is probably the number of
“words” you could type in a minute.
</p>

<p>
Note: L and R refer to left and right hand. I've also numbered the
fingers with 1 being the thumb and 5 being the pinky. The patterns I
used are based on a Dvorak keyboard, but that doesn't matter as much.
You can probably figure out what the equivalent patterns are on your
preferred keyboard layout.
</p>

<p>
Limitations: I didn't do any special calculations to deal with errors
(there were many doubling or transposition errors multi-character
sequences), so the actual CPM will be lower. Also, repeated character
sequences are definitely not normal and have quirks of their own. It's
interesting to establish the range and see the kinds of errors that show
up when I go faster than I'm comfortable with, though.

If you don't care what you're typing, it's easy to type quickly. This is
just about how fast my hands go if I don't have to think about which
finger to activate. This mostly ended up as alternating left- and
right-hand rolls (ex: aoeusntoahuesnto). Because I didn't have to
precisely alternate, two-handed mashing resulted in more characters than
one-handed mashing. Interestingly, my right hand is slightly faster than
my left.

I expected rolls to be faster than alternates, but it turns out that
alternating works out fine too (“the” and “and” on a Dvorak keyboard).
Same-hand rolls had fewer errors than alternates, though &#x2013; timing can
be tricky when doing high-speed repeats. That can be partially handled
by autocorrecting “teh” to “the” and similar transpositions. I use an
AutoHotkey-based autocorrect script, but it screws up the typing tests I
like, so I can't take advantage of it then.
</p>

<p>
A roll-optimized keyboard layout might be more effective. 3- and
4-character rolls like the ones I tested aren't that common in actual
typing, but it might be possible to find keyboard layouts that are
better-optimized for the languages I use. I've read that Arensito,
Capewell, and Colemak focus more on rolls and alternating rolls, so they
might be worth a look.

Two-character patterns are slower than three-character patterns,
probably indicating that there's a small delay as I think about
repeating things. Alternates and same-hand two-character pairs seem to
work okay. Even for same-hand two-character pairs, I get the occasional
doubling or transposition error.

Single-finger keypresses (no automatic repeats) are slow. Good thing I
don't have to do them that often. If this represents the speed at which
I can send an impulse to my finger and have it do something, this might
be a limiting factor for my typing speed, which is compensated for by
alternates and rolls.

Moving my fingers takes time too. Also, did you know that there are
typing equivalents of tongue-twisters? I can't type “ranranranran&#x2026;” a
long time without it turning into rna and other permutations. Maybe my
brain gets hiccups.

Alternating hands is actually pretty tough if you have to care about
timing. Oddly, this is slower than repositioning. Maybe it's because the
repositioning helps me remember where I am in the word when I'm
repeating it, so natural typing will be a different case.

<div id="outline-container-sec-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-8">Wrap-up</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
Chunking seems to make a big difference for me. 4-character combinations
tend to beat 3-character combinations and those tend to beat 2-character
combinations, unless there's some timing involved. Common combinations
(the, and) are easier to type. If I can get better at chunking words
into syllables, that might help. The most common digraphs are TH, HE,
AN, IN, ER, ON, RE, ED, ND, HA, AT, EN, ES, OF, NT, EA, TI, TO, IO, LE,
IS, OU, AR, AS, DE, RT, and VE
(<a href="http://scottbryce.com/cryptograms/stats.htm">source</a>), so that might
be good to look at next.
</p>

<p>
Twitching or moving individual fingers are slow operations, so being
able to “look ahead” and move my fingers to the right spots while I'm
typing the first few characters helps. Muscle memory also helps minimize
errors. Also, maybe finger dexterity and agility exercises?
</p>

<p>
I'm probably in the region of Diminishing Returns here. I could spend
hours inching up my typing speed&#x2026; or I could spend that time doing
other things. Now that I've identified specific areas to look into,
though, I might be able to set up exercises to take advantage of
interstitial time. For example, while I'm reading a book, I could do
finger dexterity exercises (pausing, of course, if I feel any hint of
strain &#x2013; I'd like to avoid RSI if I can).
</p>

<p>
On another note, testing my theoretical speed in this way reminded me a
little of how we used to play Decathlon on the computer as kids. (Was it
<a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/microsoft-decathlon/screenshots">Microsoft
Decathlon</a>? The screenshots look familiar&#x2026;) Somehow our keyboard
survived the rampage back then. =)

Because alternation can lead to typing errors or slowness for me, I
might look into Colemak, which optimizes for single-hand rolls. Still,
I'm pretty happy with Dvorak, and the
<a href="http://colemak.com/wiki/index.php?title=FAQ#Is_it_worth_switching_from_Dvorak_to_Colemak.3F">Colemak
FAQ</a> warns that the switch might not be worth it. Another thing I'm
looking into is <a href="http://plover.stenoknight.com">Plover</a>, which lets
you do stenography using a regular keyboard. My laptop keyboard can't
easily do some of the combinations and I'm more visual than phonetic
when it comes to words, so it might be a challenge to learn.
</p>

<p>
The easiest win will probably come from training my speech recognition
software to recognize my words more accurately. I've been dictating book
notes to my computer. This is great because it reinforces the key points
of the book in my memory, trains the computer, and helps me practice
clear diction. I've gotten to the point of using speech recognition to
take notes during my first pass through a book, editing after each
paragraph. I feel that the accuracy is gradually improving. I make fewer
edits as I learn how to speak the way the computer wants me to and I
teach the computer to understand the way I speak.
</p>

<p>
Besides, an average of 107 wpm on Dvorak is fast enough to let me get
words out of my head and onto my computer, and I can focus on what I
want to say instead of how to type. There's plenty more to learn about
how to write <i>efficiently./Time to go back to David Fryxell's /How to
Write Fast (While Writing Well)</i>! So it's interesting to dig into what
my rate-limiting factors are when it comes to typing faster, but it's
even better to focus on how I can think faster (although speech
recognition will still be useful for the benefits mentioned above).
</p>

<p>
Have you analyzed your typing? What did you learn?
