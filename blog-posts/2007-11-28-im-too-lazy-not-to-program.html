<p>
Yesterday, I imported five years of blog posts into WordPress through
 RSS. This would have been \<sub>painful\</sub>_ if I wasn't comfortable with
 programming. With 4587 posts in 2596 files, I wouldn't have even
 thought about copying them over manually. Instead, I would have just
 started with a clean slate. I didn't think anyone's really going to
 want to go back and see everything I've written on my blog. ;) Who was
 going to notice?
</p>

<p>
But five years of blog posts&#x2014;reflections, ideas, notes, interesting
 links&#x2014;might still be worth something, so I decided to give it a shot.
 Initially, I wrote a function which visited files, searched for notes,
 and added the note to one big RSS feed. However, this slowed down too
 much when I hit megabytes, so I changed it to dump each note to a
 file in a directory.
</p>

<pre class="example">
;(sacha/planner-dump-rss "~/public_html/blog-dump/" nil nil)
(defun sacha/planner-dump-rss (directory from to)
  (let ((pages (planner-get-day-pages from to))
        (planner-rss-feed-limits nil)
        (planner-rss-initial-contents "")
        buffer)
    (while pages
      (condition-case err2
          (progn
            (planner-find-file (caar pages))
            (setq buffer (current-buffer))
            (unwind-protect
                (progn
                  (goto-char (point-min))
                  (while (re-search-forward "^\\.#\\([0-9]+\\)" nil t)
                    (save-excursion
                      (condition-case err
                          (progn
                            (let ((inhibit-read-only t)
                                  (file (concat directory
                                                (caar pages) "-"
                                                (match-string 1))))
                              (planner-rss-add-note file)
                              (find-file file)
                              (save-buffer 0)
                              (kill-buffer (current-buffer))))
                        (error
                         (message "Problems processing note on %s: %s"
                                  (caar pages)
                                  (error-message-string err)))))))
              (kill-buffer buffer)))
        (error (message "Problems processing %s: %s"
                        (caar pages)
                        (error-message-string err2))))
      (setq pages (cdr pages)))))
</pre>

<p>
I then concatenated all of these files using
</p>

<pre class="example">
cat header 200* footer &gt; dump.rdf
</pre>

<p>
This file was still much too big, so I manually split it by year,
 copying and pasting text into different files. I used
 <a href="http://www.feedvalidator.org"><a href="http://www.feedvalidator.org">http://www.feedvalidator.org</a></a> to check
for errors. After Feedvalidator
 verified that the files were all valid RSS, I tried to import them
 into Feedwordpress. Nope, still too big. I needed to trim them to
 around 400k, so I used the following code on the server:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun sacha/split-dump ()
 (interactive)
 (goto-char (min 400000 (point-max)))
 (let ((counter 0)
 (base-name (file-name-sans-extension buffer-file-name)))
 (while (not (eobp))
 (re-search-backward "&lt;item&gt;") 
 (kill-region (match-beginning 0) (point-max))
 (insert "&lt;/channel&gt;&lt;/rss&gt;")
 (save-buffer 0)
 (find-file (format "%s%d.rdf" base-name counter))
 (erase-buffer)
 (goto-char (point-min))
 (insert "&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;
&lt;rss version=\"2.0\"&gt;
  &lt;channel&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;M-x plan :: sachachua's blog&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link&gt;http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/today.php&lt;/link&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;Sacha Chua's blog about Emacs, personal information management, open source, and random stuff&lt;/description&gt;")
      (yank)
      (setq counter (1+ counter))
      (goto-char (min 400000 (point-max))))))
</pre>

<p>
This program looks complicated, but it really isn't. In fact, I could
 have probably done something just as powerful with keyboard macros,
 not writing a single line of code. But the code was easy to write, and
 I figured that I'd keep it around just in case I needed to do
 something like this again.
</p>

<p>
After a little bit of manual tweaking, I got all the entries into
 <a href="http://sachachua.com/wp/"><a href="http://sachachua.com/wp/">http://sachachua.com/wp/</a></a> .

<p>
The ability to write short programs quickly and interactively has not
 only saved me so much time, but it's also made it possible for me to
 even \<sub>think\</sub>_ of doing some things. =) I could probably have written
 the same snippets in Perl or Ruby, but being able to combine manual
 editing and automated operations in the text editor made it just so
 much faster. I really like being able to scan back and forth in
 buffers easily in Emacs, instead of thinking in terms of
 file streams as in other programming languages.
</p>

<p>
If you work with lots of text, I definitely recommend learning Emacs
 Lisp, or whatever language your editor can be programmed in. I started
 by reading other people's source code and the Emacs Lisp Intro and
 Emacs Lisp info files. I reread them countless times, picking up a
 little more each time I went through. Now Emacs Lisp is one of the
 first things I turn to whenever I want to save time doing something
 complex and repetitive on the computer, such as adding everyone's
 pictures to a wiki page. (That's a story for next time!)
</p>

<p>
Emacs is awesome stuff. More than 20 years old, it's the most advanced
 program I've ever used. What makes it special? It's \<sub>definitely\</sub>_
 optimized for the power user, and it provides so many reasons to
 become one.
