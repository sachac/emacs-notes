I've posted ten <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/emacs-chat">Emacs Chat</a>
episodes so far, and the transcripts for the most recent ones are coming
soon. These are hour-long conversations with Emacs geeks about how they
got started with Emacs, why they like it, and how they use it. We
usually go through people's config files, too, since that often leads to
interesting tips.

</p>

<p>
I started this because it was so much fun meeting Emacs geeks in person
at the Emacs Conference in London last year. (When are we having another
one? I'm happy to sponsor a reasonable venue.) You pick up lots of tips
when you watch how someone else uses Emacs, but not everyone has the
luck of working near other Emacs geeks. (I don't!) I also wanted to get
to know other Emacs geeks so that I could “hear” their voices when
reading mailing list messages and code snippets. I wanted other people
to get that feeling of knowing people in the community &#x2013; other real
people who use Emacs.
</p>

<p>
I was pretty anxious about it in the beginning. Would I be able to ask
interesting questions, or would there be dead silence? What if I hadn't
researched people well enough? Would asking people about their
beginnings get repetitive after many episodes? I feel a little more
relaxed now. It turns out that it's easy to invite people to be on one
of these conversations, and I always find the conversation interesting.
People are so enthusiastic about Emacs. Yay!
</p>

<p>
It's been great hearing stories from people who've been using Emacs for
ages (like Iannis Zannos and Tom Marble) and people who've gotten into
Emacs fairly recently (like the way Magnar Sveen only seriously started
using it a few years ago). Org Mode frequently pops up in conversation.
I've learned about lots of other interesting packages as well, like
redshank and erefactor.
</p>

<p>
People tell me that they enjoy listening to the episodes. The episodes
are still on the long side (an hour or so, versus short-and-punchy 15-
or 30-minute chats), but they're good for picking up odd tips.
</p>

<p>
Of the little podcast experiments I've been running, the Emacs Chats
series is my favourite. Other experiments were easier to sketchnote
(which people also really enjoyed), but I like the Emacs community the
most. =)
</p>

<p>
From these experiments, I've learned that Google Hangout on Air is a
convenient way to create an audio/video show with guests. With a little
bit of work, you can turn these conversations into podcasts that people
can download and subscribe to, transcripts that people can read, and so
on.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to learn how to delegate a smoothly-running process. That
worked out really well. Now, when I finish an episode, I simply add a
card to my Trello board with the URL and my assistants will post the
show notes and the transcript for me.
</p>

<p>
I could probably make this even better by following up. I can spend more
time editing the transcripts, adding links, and summarizing key points.
Maybe I'll convert the transcripts to Org Mode and then structure things
more from there.
</p>

<p>
In terms of scheduling, picking times that are a month or two away seems
to be working well. I like proposing specific times with Boomerang
Calendar. It feels more proactive than asking people to check
<a href="http://sachachua.com/meet"><a href="http://sachachua.com/meet">http://sachachua.com/meet</a></a> for meeting
times, although both ways still involve a bit of work for the other
person since they have to check their calendar. If I suggest the times
and do the timezone conversions myself, that means we can set the time
with fewer clicks required from the other person. It doesn't feel as
stand-offish as cc-ing an assistant who may or may not be able to
quickly reply. (Although perhaps I should train my current assistants to
do this, since they seem to be fairly responsive&#x2026;)
</p>

<p>
I mostly find people through recommendations, so if you want to hear
from someone, suggest them or introduce us by e-mail. I'd love to
interview more women who use Emacs (maybe Amelia Andersdotter?), but I'm
happy to chat with all sorts of folks about Emacs. You don't have to be
famous. =) If you've got an interesting demo to share, I'd love to hear
from you too.
</p>

<p>
Onward! With Alex Poslavsky's help, I've been adding more Emacs Chats
resources to <a href="http://github.com/sachac/emacs-chats/">Github</a> so that
people can easily subscribe to it or contribute there. I noticed a few
of them were missing transcripts, so we'll work on that too. What else
would make these Emacs Chats better or more useful for you?
