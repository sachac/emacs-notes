<p>
I actually like wearing geek swag: clothes and accessories with a
 logo or geek reference. Geek swag identifies me to other geeks and
 makes it easier for geeks of similar interests to start conversations
 with me. <a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/2005.07.06#2">I'm not the
only one who thinks so.</a>
</p>

<p>
I want geek swag, but I want geek swag that fits my lifestyle.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I occasionally wear T-shirts. My Linux conference baby tee is
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
much-loved and often-worn.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I really want some kind of geek bag, but I also want my
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
multi-compartment tote with all sorts of nifty pockets.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I want a geek sweater or hoodie that I can wear more often than a
</li>
</ul>
<p>
T-shirt.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I want geek earrings. (Anyone who makes pretty Tux earrings for a
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
reasonable price will have my business.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I want an index card holder with a pen loop. This is more for my
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
D*I*Y Planner geekiness.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I want stickers. My current sticker reads “The geek shall inherit
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
the earth.” It's bright red and white, and can't help but draw
 attention to my ubercute-and-small laptop.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I want a D*I*Y 1″ or 1.5″ zippered binder, just because. Yes, I have
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
far too many binders already. That doesn't stop me from wanting a
 D*I*Y Planner one.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Okay. Let's see. I can focus on making either a geek hoodie or a geek
 bag, and then move on from there.
</p>

<p>
Hmmmm.
</p>

<p>
I know people who have silkscreened stuff.
</p>

<p>
Heck, I stenciled a shirt in grade school. And it turned out quite
 good, too.
</p>

<p>
I should be able to do it again, but this time, cooler.
</p>

<p>
I should learn how to silkscreen. That'll probably be easier once I
figure out how to get frames sorted out&#x2026;
