Do tell me what happened with your web development company. At the
 moment, I'm wondering what caused you to initiate your one-hour hack.
</p>

<p>
Just Because I Can. &lt;impish grin&gt; Never underestimate an annoyed
 geekette with a block of free time.

<p>
Seriously, keeping track of how much time it takes me to actually
 implement things&#x2026; Wow. Thanks to

I can tell you how long
 something took to implement. That's given me a newfound appreciation
 for lunch hour and (formerly) free time. Lunch hour is another new
 planner feature, or a new website look, or a few new discoveries on
 the Net.

I don't think we'll be needing the web dev company any more. I think
 that at this point we aren't likely to see significant improvements
 with professional design, given that the company isn't into
 copywriting. I would've greatly appreciated the services of a real
 copywriter who can, say, review our documents and write for the web,
 but the web firms in the Philippines don't offer this as a service. I
 suppose I'll just have to trust my senses when it comes to the Net.
 The current <a href="http://www.adphoto.com.ph">Adphoto website</a> is still
 too marketing-fluffy for my tastes, but I can tweak that when I get
 better ideas.
