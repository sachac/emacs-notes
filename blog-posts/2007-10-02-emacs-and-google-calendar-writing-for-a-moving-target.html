While searching for Emacs calendar sync, I came across Bill Clementson's
post on <a href="http://bc.tech.coop/blog/070306.html">Emacs and Google
Calendars</a>. He showed how to use the Emacs Client for Google Services
to add items to the Google calendar and to the local diary file at the
same time. I might look into that.
</p>

<p>
The
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/WickedCoolEmacs">WickedCoolEmacs</a>
book may take a little more work than expected. I
 want to include not only what's already out there, but what logically
 makes sense to include&#x2014;and that might take some hacking on my part as
 well. With a little over a year to go before my deadline, I'm sure
 that Emacs will also move quite a bit. I think the best thing to do is
 to divide my outline into:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Built-in packages that I have personal experience with
</li>
<li>External packages I have personal experience with
</li>
<li>Built-in packages I need to learn about
</li>
<li>External packages I need to learn about
</li>
<li>Built-in packages I need to tinker with
</li>
<li>External packages I need to tinker with
</li>
<li>Stuff I have to write from scratch
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If I can get all the low-hanging fruit during my first pass, then I
 can go back and re-edit the chapters to include more.

Random Emacs symbol: ebnf-print-directory &#x2013; Command: Generate and print
a PostScript syntactic chart image of DIRECTORY.
