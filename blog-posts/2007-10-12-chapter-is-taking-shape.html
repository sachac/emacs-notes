 about Org and Planner]], I'm starting to feel more comfortable with
 the chapter that I'm writing. I pasted my draft into OpenOffice and
 found to my surprise that I have about 13 pages of content, with 7
 more to go.

<p>
I'm comfortable working with the book as an org outline, and I really
 love how it lets me navigate the outline and mark segments as TODO or
 DRAFT. I think I'd rather draft it in Emacs than in OpenOffice.org,
 where I'll be tempted to fiddle with formatting and editing. I'll use
 longlines-mode to draft my book so that I can paste it into OpenOffice
 for a rough idea of the page count, but that'll be my only concession.
=)

<p>
I'll put the chapter together before sending it to beta readers, which
 would basically be the people who've e-mailed me or commented on my
 book-related blog entries. If you want to be a beta reader, now's a
 good time to volunteer! It involves reading rough drafts and going,
 “Ooh, that \<sub>is\</sub>_ cool,” or even better, “Hey, you missed this totally
 awesome Emacs trick&#x2026;” =) Encouragement will help keep me going, too!
