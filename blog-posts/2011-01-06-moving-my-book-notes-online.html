<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3968124/books.org.txt">I moved more of my book
notes online</a>, reasoning that a braindump is better than occasional
whining about the lack of a good system. ;) Fellow Emacs geeks who use
Org will probably get the most out of this, as they can open it in Emacs
and work with the hierarchy, but someday I may figure out a neat little
hyperlinked solution that will make it easy for everyone else. Or I'll
pull more and more of these posts into my blog, where they'll be
individually linkable and commentable.
</p>

<p>
Compare:
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/category/book/"><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/category/book/">http://sachachua.com/blog/category/book/</a></a>
, which wins points for being graphical and highlighted and
comment-friendly, but loses topical organization, overview, search, and
offline access.
</p>

<p>
It's a start. Here's what's working well:
</p>

<p>
<b>CAPTURE:</b> Using Org + Remember to capture book notes uses the same
process as my other notes. Diagrams can be scanned in and attached to
files. I used to scan and OCR dogeared pages, but typing or dictating
them in is okay, and it helps me review. The capture part of my process
is fantastic.
</p>

<p>
<b>ORGANIZATION:</b> org-refile or copying and pasting are easy, so this part
of the process is fine.
</p>

<p>
<b>REVIEW:</b> I might schedule times to refresh my memory of certain books.
I can do that with Org agenda fairly easily.
</p>

<p>
<b>SHARING:</b> Here's where the process breaks down a little.
org2blog-post-subtree is great, and I've used that a number of times to
post the relevant subtree of book notes. That adds the notes as entries
in my blog, storing the post ID in my Org file so that I can get back to
the post afterwards. org2blog also makes it easy to edit entries,
hooray.
</p>

<p>
Once it's in my blog, people can use the categories to find other
entries. However, my current blog layout doesn't highlight the
categories, and it's not easy to browse the different book-related
categories. Maybe it's worth tweaking a “reading” or “book” category
layout page.
</p>

<p>
Aha! How's
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/book-notes/"><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/book-notes/">http://sachachua.com/blog/book-notes/</a></a>
? It's a manually-edited list at the top (thanks, Org!), followed by an
automatically-generated index. I'll gradually move my other notes into
this system &#x2013; text notes in my Org file and blog entries for
linkability/commentability. Progress&#x2026;
