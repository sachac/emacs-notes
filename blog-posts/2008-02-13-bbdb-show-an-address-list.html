I sometimes feel like bringing out my stationery, my fountain pen, and a
coil of stamps, and writing cards to random people in my address book.
When I travel, I also enjoy writing quick postcards to people who live
in the country I'm visiting. That's why I wrote this code to filter my
address book so that I could see only the contacts with snail-mail
addresses, or only the contacts whose snail-mail addresses match a
regular expression.
</p>

<p>
You can call <b>M-x wicked/bbdb-find-people-with-addresses</b> to filter the
displayed BBDB records. Press RET at the “Regexp: ” prompt in order to
show all records with addresses, or type in a regular expression that
matches anything in the addresses field. By default,
</p>

<p>
wicked/bbdb-find-people-with-addresses works on the BBDB records already
shown in the <b>BBDB</b> window, or all records if none are shown. This
allows you to successively filter BBDB records. (Combined with the other
BBDB projects I'll blog about, you'll be able to get a list of all the
people you haven't talked to in three months but who you've talked to
within the year, who are interested in Emacs and cooking but not social
networking, and who have a phone number in your contact database! How's
<i>that</i> for targeted mail? ;) ) Anyway, if you want to start your search
from scratch and you don't want to call <b>M-x bbdb</b> with . as the regular
expression, use the universal prefix argument (<b>C-u M-x
wicked/bbdb-find-people-with-addresses</b>) and it will search your entire
contact database.
</p>

<p>
Have fun! =)
