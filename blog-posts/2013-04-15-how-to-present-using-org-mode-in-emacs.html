You can do pretty much everything in Emacs, so why not give
presentations too? <a href="http://orgmode.org">Org-mode</a> is an extensible
outliner and Swiss Army knife for the Emacs text editor. Because it's a
great way to organize information, people have written a number of
packages for presenting information from Org.
</p>

<p>
Here are some options for preparing and giving presentations using
Org-mode, along with some guidance on what to use when. It may be a good
idea to browse through the examples and create a small test presentation
using the systems that catch your eye. If you choose your system before
drafting your presentation, that can save you a lot of time, since the
approaches differ in terms of the code you'll need to add to your Org
file.

Do you need to distribute your presentation to non-Emacs users, or do
you want to minimize the risk of getting your Emacs configuration
confused? You can export your presentation to a number of formats.
</p>

<p>
<b>Export to Beamer (LaTeX) and generate a PDF</b>: Use this if you need to
distribute your presentation as a PDF. You will need to install LaTeX,
which could be a bit heavy-weight. Beamer is a slide package for LaTeX,
and Org can export an outline to LaTeX code. Check out
<a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/beamer/tutorial.html">Writing Beamer
presentations in Org-mode</a> for sample screenshots and a tutorial.
</p>

<p>
<b>Export to HTML and use S5</b>: Light-weight browser-based slideshows are
becoming more popular. They can be distributed as ZIPs or .tar.gz, or
uploaded to web servers. See the section in the Org tutorials for
<a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/non-beamer-presentations.html#sec-3">Non-Beamer
Presentations: S5</a>. Here are some
<a href="http://eschulte.github.io/org-S5/">sample presentations</a>.

Presenting within Emacs allows you to edit your presentation, execute
code, or do all sorts of other interesting things. And it doesn't have
to be plain text &#x2013; Org allows you to include inline images. (Microsoft
Windows users may need to install additional libraries &#x2013;
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2650041/emacs-under-windows-and-png-files">see
StackOverflow for tips</a>.)
</p>

<p>
There are several ways to present from Org-mode. They tend to differ on:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the markup you need to add to your slides
</li>
<li>the keyboard shortcuts to help you navigate between slides
</li>
</ul>

<p>
so you can choose the one you feel the most comfortable with.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/rlister/org-present">Org-present</a> is simple and
defines very few keyboard shortcuts: left for previous slide, right for
next slide, C-c C-= or C-c C&#x2013; to adjust text size, and C-q to quit.
This makes it easy to edit your presentation as you go along. You'll
need to edit your ~/.emacs file to include some code. See the
documentation in org-present.el for details.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/eschulte/epresent">EPresent</a> is a bit more
complex. It supports converting LaTeX into images, so you can embed
pretty equations. The epresent keybindings include “n” for next and “p”
for previous, so don't use this if you're planning to edit your
presentation on the fly.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/nicferrier/org-presie">Org-presie</a> takes a
different approach by showing the outline instead of focusing on just
one slide. When you press SPC, the previous headline's content is
hidden, and the next one's content is expanded. It's good for always
giving people a sense of where they are in your presentation.
</p>

<p>
And then sometimes you may want to write your own. For my presentation
at Emacs Conference 2013, I wanted to be able to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>allow me to indicate various headings as slides so that I can
organize an outline of slides (why should they all have to be
top-level?),
</li>
<li>for each slide

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>automatically execute pre-written Emacs Lisp code (for animations
and demonstrations!), OR
</li>
<li>display images that fit the full height or width of the window, OR
</li>
<li>display text if I don't specify code or images
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>and have globally-set keyboard shortcuts so that I can go forward,
backward, or re-do a slide no matter where I am in Emacs (and with
AutoHotkey, even when I'm in a non-Emacs window)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can find my code at
<a href="https://gist.github.com/sachac/5278905"><a href="https://gist.github.com/sachac/5278905">https://gist.github.com/sachac/5278905</a></a>
</p>

<p>
Emacs and Org-mode are wonderfully customizable, so you can probably
build something that works just the way you want to work. Enjoy!
