I came across this beautiful quote from Anne Patchett's memoir “Truth
 and Beauty” on the
<a href="http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_projerct/2007/11/this-saturday-1.html">Happiness
Project blog</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“I knew then it was just too enormous for me to manage and that
 worrying about her would swamp me. If I was swamped by worry, I would
 be useless to her. It was even possible that I would desert her, and
 that was the thing that could never happen. I decided that night I
 would take all the hourts of my life that could so easily be spent
 worrying and instead I would try to help her.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's it. That makes sense. I can't afford to feel all down about
 myself, boohoo, I'm living in two worlds and all of that. Not when I
 can take that time and that energy and do something <b>wonderful.</b>
