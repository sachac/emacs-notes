Overloaded with e-mail? Overcome inbox insanity by using
<a href="http://www.plannerlove.com">Planner</a> to
 keep track of what you need to do. If you use Emacs as your mail
 client, then Planner's automatic hyperlinking can help you capture and
 organize your tasks.
</p>

<p>
Capture
</p>

<p>
Create planner tasks whenever e-mail requires you to act. That way,
 you don't have to hunt through your inbox every time you need to
 figure out what to work on. If your response to an e-mail will take
 less than two minutes and you know you won't get distracted, go ahead
 and act on it immediately; you don't need to capture it. If you want
 to track your action for completeness, create a task for it. Planner
 makes it so easy to capture and organize tasks that even two-minute
 tasks are still worth recording.
</p>

<p>
Tasks are automatically linked to the e-mail message being viewed,
 making it easy to return to the original message for more details. You
 can schedule tasks immediately or leave them on today's page. If you
 want tasks to be undated by default, set planner-expand-name-default
 to nil.
</p>

<p>
Create planner tasks whenever you need to follow up a task you've
 delegated to someone else. Assign it to a different plan page. If you
 prefer to use a single plan page, make task sorting easier by adding a
 keyword to the description (ex: #A \_ +waiting for year-end sales
 report : E-Mail from Jim). This makes it easy to review all the things
 you're waiting for.
</p>

<p>
Write clear and concise task descriptions. “Prepare year-end sales
 report” is a better task description than “Work on this”. Planner will
 automatically add the e-mail author's name as a hyperlink, like “:
 E-Mail from Kathy”.
</p>

<p>
Organize
</p>

<p>
Using Planner to keep track of your e-mail related tasks also makes it
 easier for you to organize and plan your day. E-mail doesn't let you
 specify when you want to work on something, but Planner lets you
 schedule your tasks onto specific days. It can also carry over
 unfinished tasks, so you know that nothing will slip through the
 cracks.
</p>

<p>
After you've read all your e-mail and responded to everything you
 could quickly process, you can choose when to work on other tasks that
 take more time. Review your list of e-mail-related tasks and start
 organizing them.
</p>

<p>
You can schedule a task onto a particular day by using
 planner-copy-or-move-task (C-c C-c) while point is on the task. You
 can specify actual dates (yyyy.mm.dd, mm.dd, or just dd), or you can
 use Planner's relative dates features to schedule things for next
 Friday (+fri), two days from now (+2), or even the 3rd Tuesday after
 March 1 (+3tue3.1). Use planner-copy-or-move-region to schedule
 multiple tasks.
</p>

<p>
You can schedule tasks for particular times as well. Simply add time
 (ex: @1000-1300) to your task description using
 planner-edit-task-description (bind this to a shortcut key if you use
 it often). Modules like planner-appt.el can extract the time
 information and display your schedule, and you can change your
 planner-sort-tasks-key-function to sort tasks by time first and then
 by priority.
</p>

<p>
And there you have it&#x2014;an organized way to make sense of your inbox by
 making it easy to see just what you need to do.
</p>

<p>
Set up

 <a href="http://my.gnus.org"><a href="http://my.gnus.org">http://my.gnus.org</a></a> .
</p>
</blockquote>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Bind planner-create-task-from-buffer to a keyboard shortcut you can
</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>
use from anywhere. For example, add the following line to your ~/emacs
 in order to use C-c t as your create-task shortcut:
</p>
</blockquote>

<pre class="example">
(global-set-key "\C-ct" 'planner-create-task-from-buffer)
</pre>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Load the Planner module corresponding to your preferred mail client:
