<p>
The section on projects introduced tags as a way to differentiate
 active and inactive projects. In this section, you'll learn more about
 tags and how you can use them to filter your task list.
</p>

<p>
What's a tag, anyway? In Org, tags are keywords at the end of
 headlines. Each tag can contain letters, numbers, and the symbols ‘\<sub>'</sub>
 and ‘@'. Tags begin and end with colons, and a single colon separates
 multiple tags. For example, you could have headlines like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Personal                                     :PERSONAL:
** TODO Buy milk                               :@ERRANDS:
** TODO Call Mom                               :@PHONE:
** TODO Send letters                           :@ERRANDS:
* Work                                         :WORK:
** TODO Call John about report                 :@PHONE:JOHN:
** TODO Prepare for presentation on Monday
** TODO Call Mary about the presentation       :@PHONE:URGENT:MARY:
</pre>

<p>
One way to use tags is to filter your task list by priority. For
 example, you may want to focus on your urgent tasks first without
 getting distracted by other items on your task list. Another way to
 use tags is to keep track of the context of your tasks as suggested in
 GTD. By doing similar tasks together, you might be able to work more
 efficiently. For example, if you're on the phone at the office, it may
 be a good idea to do all of your work-related phone calls. If you're
 going to go to the post office, you might want to drop by the
 supermarket on your way back. You can use tags to categorize your
 headlines any way you want.
</p>

<p>
Tags can take advantage of the outline structure. For example,
 although the tasks “Buy milk”, “Call Mom”, and “Send letters” have one
 tag each, they also inherit the “PERSONAL” tag from the parent
 headline. A tag search for “PERSONAL” would display all three
 tasks. To customize this behavior, look at the documentation for the
 variables org-use-tag-inheritance and org-tags-match-list-sublevels.
</p>

<p>
Tags can help you organize and filter your task list. In this section,
 you'll learn how to add tags to your headlines, view tagged items in
 your Org file and in your agenda, and define custom agenda
 views. You'll also learn about custom tag searches and other
 interesting things you can do once you've tagged your headlines.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Adding tags</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
You can edit your ~/organizer.org file and add tags manually by typing
 in :tagname: at the end of the headline. You can also add tags by
 typing C-c C-c (org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c) when the point is on a
 headline. Use M-TAB (complete-symbol) to complete a tag based on all
 the tags used in the current file. If Alt-TAB is not processed by
 Emacs, you can use ESC-TAB instead.
</p>

<p>
Separate multiple tags with a single colon, like this:
 (:@PHONE:URGENT:). The beginning and ending colons are optional when
 using C-c C-c (org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c), because the function will
 automatically add them.
</p>

<p>
If you add certain tags frequently, you can set up single-key
 shortcuts. For example, if you frequently tag tasks as “URGENT”, you
 may want to define a shortcut (at least until your life gets under
 control). You can assign shortcuts globally by adding this code to
 your ~/.emacs and evaluating it:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq org-tag-alist '(("URGENT" . ?u)
                      ("@PHONE" . ?p)
                      ("@ERRANDS" . ?e)))
</pre>

<p>
You can also set this on a per-file basis by adding the following line
 to the beginning of your file:
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+TAGS: URGENT(u) @PHONE(p) @ERRANDS(e)
</pre>

<p>
You can then use these C-c C-c (org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c) to enter these
 single-key shortcuts, ending it with RET. If you are assigning a
 single tag, type C-c C-c C-c (org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c, next change exits) to
 make it even faster by skipping the RET.
</p>

<p>
If you use single-key shortcuts, you'll need another way to enter tags
 that start with the shortcut key. You can type them in manually, or
 you can use C-c C-c (org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c) and type TAB to enter in any
tag.
</p>

<p>
To remove a tag, you could use C-c C-c (org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c) again, or
 delete it manually. To remove all tags, use C-c C-c
 (org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c) and press SPC.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Viewing tagged items</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Whether you want to view tagged headlines by themselves or in the
 context of your other headlines, tasks, and notes, Org has some nifty
 tagging features for you.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">Agenda view</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
To view tagged headlines by themselves, use C-c a m (org-agenda,
 org-tags-view) and specify the search tag. For example, you can view
 your urgent tasks by specifying “URGENT”. Note that this command
 displays the top headlines matching that tag, whether they're tasks or
 not. For example, if you searched for “WORK”, you would just get the
 “* Work” headline. To view tagged tasks, use C-c a M (org-agenda,
 org-tags-view with a prefix argument). This shows only the tasks that
 have that tag.
</p>

<p>
To search for a combination of tags, you can combine tags like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
WORK&amp;@PHONE           only your work phone calls
PERSONAL-@ERRANDS     personal tasks, but without errands
JOHN|MARY             Anything tagged with "JOHN" or "MARY"
                      For example, if you're going to have a meeting with both of them
</pre>

<p>
If you check certain lists often, you might want to create a custom
 agenda command for them. In the section on Projects, you configured
 custom agenda commands for active and inactive projects by adding the
 following code in your ~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("p" tags "PROJECT-MAYBE-DONE" nil)
        ("m" tags "PROJECT&amp;MAYBE" nil)
        ("a" "My agenda"
         ((org-agenda-list)
          (tags "PROJECT-MAYBE-DONE")))
        ;; ... put your other custom commands here
       ))
</pre>

<p>
You can use the same idea to create quick custom views for your other
 tagged tasks. For example, to create custom views for your urgent work
 tasks and your phone calls, modify the org-agenda-custom-commands
 setting in your ~/.emacs to be like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("u" todo "WORK&amp;URGENT" nil)               ;; (1)
        ("c" todo "WORK&amp;@PHONE" nil)               ;; (2)
        ("h" todo "PERSONAL-@ERRANDS" nil)         ;; (3)
        ("p" tags "PROJECT-MAYBE-DONE" nil)        ;; (4)
        ("m" tags "PROJECT&amp;MAYBE" nil)
        ("a" "My agenda"
         ((org-agenda-list)
          (tags-todo "URGENT")                     ;; (5)
          (tags "PROJECT-MAYBE-DONE")))            ;; (6)
        ;; ... put your other custom commands here
       ))
</pre>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(1) “u” is for “urgent”, “todo” specifies that TODO headlines are to
be shown, “WORK&amp;URGENT” is the query string, and the last item means
that there aren't any options
</li>
<li>(2) “c” is for “call”
</li>
<li>(3) “h” is for “home”
</li>
<li>(4) The second item here is “tags” instead of “todo”, which means
that the highest-level matching headlines should be shown whether or
not they're tasks.
</li>
<li>(5) This is how to add a tag search for tasks into a custom agenda
command.
</li>
<li>(6) This is how to add a tag search for headlines into a custom
agenda command.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Sometimes you'll want to see more context instead of just a list of
 headlines. You can jump from your Org agenda to the corresponding
 headline by pressing RET (org-agenda-switch-to) on the entry. You can
 also quickly browse through the headlines in another window by
 pressing f (org-agenda-follow-mode) while in the Org agenda view, then
 moving your point to the different lines. These commands work with the
 summary in the Org agenda view.
</p>

<p>
If you want to show only matching headlines in your ~/organizer.org
 file, you can use Org's sparse tree search commands.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">In your agenda file</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
A sparse tree shows only the matching headlines in the context of the
 headlines above them. This is useful when you want to see your tasks
 within your outline structure. All other headlines are collapsed so
 that they're easy to skip. To do a sparse tree search, type C-c \
 (org-tags-sparse-tree). You can then expand and collapse subtrees with
 the TAB (org-cycle) command. To limit the search to only task
 headlines, type C-u C-c \ (org-tags-sparse-tree with a prefix).
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Other cool things you can do with tags</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
And if you ever want to know how much time you spent on urgent tasks,
 you can call the following function from your organizer.org file with:
</p>

<pre class="example">
M-x wicked/org-calculate-tag-time RET URGENT RET
</pre>

<p>
to see something like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Time: 98:44 (98 hours and 44 minutes)
</pre>

<p>
You can call it with a prefix in order to be prompted for a start time
 (inclusive) and end time (exclusive).
</p>

<p>
Here's the code to add to your ~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun wicked/org-calculate-tag-time (matcher &amp;optional ts te)
  "Return the total minutes clocked in headlines matching MATCHER.
MATCHER is a string or a Lisp form to be evaluated, testing if a
given set of tags qualifies a headline for inclusion. TS and TE
are time start (inclusive) and time end (exclusive). Call with a
prefix to be prompted for TS and TE.

For example, to see how much time you spent on tasks tagged as
URGENT, call M-x wicked/org-calculate-tag-time RET URGENT RET. To
see how much time you spent on tasks tagged as URGENT today, call
C-u M-x wicked/org-calculate-tag-time RET URGENT RET . RET +1 RET."
  (interactive (list
        (read-string "Tag query: ")
        (if current-prefix-arg (org-read-date))
        (if current-prefix-arg (org-read-date))))
  ;; Convert strings to proper arguments
  (if (stringp matcher) (setq matcher (cdr (org-make-tags-matcher matcher))))
  (if (stringp ts)
      (setq ts (time-to-seconds (apply 'encode-time (org-parse-time-string ts)))))

        (setq i (1- i)))
      ;; add the nex tags
      (when tags
        (setq tags (mapcar 'downcase (org-split-string tags ":"))

          (cons (cons level tags) tags-alist)))
      ;; compile tags for current headline
      (setq tags-list

    total))
</pre>

<p>
Now you can slice and dice your timeclock records any way you want,
thanks to tags!
