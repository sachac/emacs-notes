All sorts of goodies in the new Emacs 22. I've just sent a ZIP of the
 article and some images off to Don Marti, and I
 look forward to merciless editing. I won't be able to post it on my
 blog until some time after it gets released, but that was fun to
 write.

<p>
I had to trim so much material from the individual sections.
 Post-thesis, I should really start an Emacs column&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Chatting on #emacs gave me an interesting idea. You know, that Livin'
 la Vida Emacs talk I gave at DemoCamp would be great as a
 polished talk that I could take on a tour. Post-thesis (or maybe
 mostly-done-thesis), I should take to the road and go across US and
 Canada talking about tech and meeting up with all sorts of cool
 people. It'll be a great excuse to visit Google and Amazon, which must
 have lots of incredibly cool Emacs users.
