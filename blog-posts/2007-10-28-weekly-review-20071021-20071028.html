<p>
UP: My second week of work was dominated by CASCON, the conference
 organized by the IBM Toronto Center for Advanced Studies. I presented
 a short paper about my thesis, summarizing 72 pages and 1.5 years of
 my life into five minutes and what really amounts to this sentence:
 “Blogs, bookmarks, and people-tags may be able to help people find
 expertise within their company, so let's make a search engine that
 combines all three.” I also enjoyed helping out with Stephen
 Perelgut's Second Life workshop, even though only half of the people
 could get on the metaverse. Aaron, Bernie and I met a couple of times
 during the conference, and I did manage to squeeze in some “real work”
 as well. I also had my two-week check-in with my manager. We're
 thinking of making those weekly, just to keep everyone in the loop. A
 couple of market scans here and there, some podcast plans&#x2026; work is
 good, and getting even better.
</p>

<p>
UP: I got back in touch with Gino Ledesma, a friend of mine from
 university. We had a lot of fun catching up. I was thrilled to hear
 about what he and my other batchmates have been up to, and
 particularly by the way he's been giving back to the Philippines. His
 company is very impressed by him and is looking for more Filipinos to
 hire. That's gotta be something. =) That reminds me: I need to
 introduce him to Winston Damarillo, who might be interested in having
 Gino give some presentations to his Java folks.
</p>

<p>
DOWN: Trapeze lessons have been postponed. It was an informal class in
 somebody's loft, and that somebody needs to now focus on med school.
 Ah well. Time to look for another form of exercise. I don't really
 feel like spending money on this, and I'm sure I can find plenty of
 free, fun ways to exercise around the house. Winter is coming, so
 running might not be my cup of tea. I'll look around for ideas.
</p>

<p>
DOWN: The paperwork requirements for the permanent residency
 application are a little bit intimidating, aren't they? I felt
 overwhelmed earlier. W- gave me a wonderful hug and helped me remember
 to divide and conquer.
</p>

<p>
UP: I've found a good way to get more material for my book. =) It's
 easy for me to write if I think of things as blog posts. Even basic
 information is fun to share. But I need to protect that time. I
 managed to write a little bit during the evenings, and more during the
 weekends. Let's see if that works out next week too.

<p>
DOWN: The downside to this is that I'm not sure how to make the time
 to meet my friends face-to-face. I'm growing a lot more protective of
 the rare four-hour chunks I can carve out of my day, so I tend to keep
 the weekends for myself. A wonderful home life makes me want to spend
 more time at home instead of going to cafes and meeting friends. Blogs
 are easy to fit into the spaces in my day, but what about the friends
 who don't blog? I'll try tweaking my schedule a bit this week.
 Tomorrow I'm going to go to DemoCamp, but only the pub night part, and
 I'm planning to go after dinner. It doesn't make that much sense to go
 back and forth considering I'm working from downtown, but I can do
 productive things on the subway (hmm, rush hour, so that means
 listening to a podcast or doing blue-sky thinking), and I do like
 being there when J- comes home from school. =)
</p>

<p>
DOWN: E-mail is also lower on my priority list. It's becoming easier
 to tell myself, “I'm going to do one hour of e-mail, and that's that.”
 Or 30 minutes, or whatever time I can set aside. I'm a little mixed
 about this because a number of books I've read recommended quick
 responses as a way of showing you care, but as long as expectations
 are also adjusted, I think things will be fine. If I take a long time
 to reply, it's just that I have other priorities.
</p>

<p>
UP: And somehow I still found the time to read library books and
 encode more notes, too! =) I probably won't be updating my Booksnake
 blog for a while (again, other priorities!), but my workflow is
 getting better.
</p>

<p>
UP: I'm happy with the overall balance of this week. My 50,000-feet
 view is becoming clearer: I want to become a
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/2007.10.23.php#anchor-1">practice
evangelist</a>,
 <a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/2007.10.26.php#anchor-1">business
practice maven,</a> or whatever the proper term is. On the
 ground-view, I manage to complete most of my planned tasks without
 feeling as if I'm wasting time. In terms of personal stuff, I'm doing
 well, too. =) Happy with this week, can't wait for the next.
