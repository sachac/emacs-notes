<h1 class="title">Thoughts on Toodledo versus Emacs Org</h1>

<p>
It's been a couple of months since I switched to using the Toodledo
instead of Emacs Org to manage my tasks. I decided to use Toodledo
because I wanted a to-do list that I could access on any computer and on
my iPod Touch, so that I could capture tasks from anywhere. I liked
Toodledo more than I liked Remember the Milk because Toodledo's tagging
and time-tracking features fit the way I work. I also liked how I could
ask my virtual assistant to fill in templates&#x2013;for example, preparation
tasks for upcoming presentations&#x2013;based on certain dates.
</p>

<p>
I still like Toodledo, but I feel an unsatisfied itch. Toodle-do is a
great Getting Things Done system for capturing and tracking tasks, but
even though it has some support for defining short-, medium-, and
long-term goals, I wasn't using them because they were split up on
multiple screens. I missed the outlines of Org where I could define my
higher-level goals, easily add new ones, and create tasks and subtasks.
I missed the close integration with my schedule and the ability to
easily see my historical task information. I missed the distinction
between scheduled dates and deadlines, and the calculation of days until
something is due.
</p>

<p>
So I think it's time to switch back, at least temporarily. Maybe I can
find a way to seamlessly synchronize my Org files so that changes are
reflected on the different computers I'm on, and maybe I can find a way
to easily capture or review tasks while I'm on the go. Perhaps I'll
continue working on org-toodledo so that I can export tasks from Org to
the web-based interface. That way, I can quickly review today's tasks
while I'm out and about.

Hmm&#x2026;
