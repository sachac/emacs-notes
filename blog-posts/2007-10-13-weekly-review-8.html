I had <b>awesome</b> conversations again this week. I greatly enjoyed meeting
Jennifer Dodd, <a href="http://www.scimatic.com">Jamie McQuay</a>, and Hartwell
Fong at Farcoast last Wednesday. We talked about so much: science
outreach, Second Life, quantum computing&#x2026; Then there's yesterday's
conversation with <a href="http://www.falsepositives.com">Ian Irving</a> about
tech evangelism and consulting. This is amazing stuff. I want more
people to enjoy these great conversations! =)
</p>

<p>
I've been getting ready for my job at IBM, which starts on Monday. I
 checked the public transit route to 3600 Steeles, and
 Stephen Perelgut is right: it's not
 complicated. I'm getting used to wearing grownup clothes, too! ;)
Yesterday, W- complimented my pairing of a gray cashmere turtleneck with
a gray dress. I'm finding myself drawn to neutral bases (white and gray
for the most part, with a bit of black), and I'm now looking for a few
accessories to add color and whats-it.
</p>

<p>
I made more progress on my book. I spent some time learning how to use
 Org, and feel comfortable enough with it to write the section on
 planning my day. I think I understand it now. I'm also comfortable
 with planner-appt, and I'm going to recommend that over the little
 hack I put together before.
</p>

<p>
This has also been a great week for exercise. I went to trapeze
 classes twice thanks to W-'s encouragement, and have successfully been
 able to hook my knees over the bar or hold my legs extended over my
 head without assistance. Whee!
</p>

<p>
My goals for next week are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Finish the raw text for the first chapter in my book.
</li>
<li>Get on board smoothly: find out my manager's expectations, help him
figure out a great way to use and develop me, finish the onboarding
paperwork, and set up direct deposit
</li>
<li>Make it smoothly onto the bar in trapeze classes
</li>
<li>Attend the Toronto Public Library board meeting to see if I'll make
it my primary charity this year
</li>
<li>Contact the U of T Career Centre; also, see if I can access the
contact directory
</li>
<li>Connect with Mohan and see what I can do to help, or what holes there
are in my Web 2.0 network
</li>
<li>And if there's time, I want to figure out how to blog using Org, too.
</li>
</ul>
