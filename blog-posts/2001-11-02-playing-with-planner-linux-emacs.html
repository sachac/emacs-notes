Today's been a busy day. I don't suppose I can get planner to nicely
work with all the rest of emacs, can it? I rather like emacswiki&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Alright, seems to be fine. Planner's actually pretty nifty. I'll pop the
description into my remembrance agent index on the next scan, I suppose;
maybe it'll be useful.
</p>

<p>
I wonder if I can get the wiki to recognize non-wiki words. That would
be pretty nice.

Off to dinner with me now.

This was my very first post. I was trying out the note-taking
capabilities of Emacs Planner. In the beginning, it didn't support
blogging. I built that feature afterwards, and eventually migrated my
posts over to WordPress when I decided to move blogging systems.
</p>

<p>
Planner was a personal information manager for the Emacs text editor. I
had picked up Emacs again after rereading Unix Power Tools, and I was
curious about some of the packages that were available for it. Planner
looked like a great way to keep track of my tasks and notes. The
Remembrance Agent mentioned here was another bit of software available
for Emacs. It continuously looked at a few hundred words around your
cursor and suggested relevant files, which was a really cool way to find
out that you'd written about something similar and had completely
forgotten about it. I've since then moved on to using
<a href="http://orgmode.org">Emacs Org Mode</a> to manage my tasks, although I
haven't quite replaced the “Here are other things similar to this”
functionality provided by Remembrance Agent. I just write about things
again and again.
