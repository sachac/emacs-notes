</p>

<p>
So you want to use Org as day planner. I'll show you the bare minimum
that you need in order to use Org to manage your tasks day by day. I
assume that you've set up Org and Remember according to the basic
configuration suggested in “Setup.” If you haven't done that yet, please
review the section on “Setup”, then return here.
</p>

<p>
Here's what you'll learn how to do:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Collect your tasks
</li>
<li>Schedule the tasks for specific days
</li>
<li>View your daily or weekly agenda
</li>
<li>Mark tasks as done
</li>
<li>Reschedule a task
</li>
<li>Review your accomplishments
</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Collecting your tasks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
If you're adding many tasks, you may find it easier to edit your
Organizer file. Open ~/organizer.org in Emacs and go to the end of the
file. Add headlines like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Inbox
** TODO your task description here
** TODO another task...
</pre>

<p>
Instead of typing ** TODO again and again, you can use C-M-RET to create
another TODO heading at the same level as the previous one. Think of all
the things you need to do over the next few days and add them to your
Org agenda file.
</p>

<p>
More tasks will come up as you work on things. Instead of switching to
your Org agenda file each time you need to add a task, you can use C-c r
t (remember, Tasks template) to remember the task quickly. Try it now by
typing C-c r t. Type in the task description and press C-c C-c
(org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c) to add the task to the end of the ~/organizer.org
file.
</p>

<p>
Now you have plenty of tasks on your list, but no idea when you need to
do that. Here's where scheduling and deadlines come in.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Scheduling tasks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
To schedule a task, move your cursor to the TODO headline and press C-c
C-s (org-schedule). Org will prompt you for a date. It understands full,
partial, and relative dates. For example, if today is December 29, 2007,
then It understands any of the following:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="right" />

<col  class="right" />

<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="right">Input</td>
<td class="right">Result</td>
<td class="left">Explanation</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right">(blank)</td>
<td class="right">2007-12-30</td>
<td class="left">Today</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right">10:30</td>
<td class="right">2007-12-30 10:30</td>
<td class="left">Time today</td>

<td class="right">3:30pm</td>
<td class="right">2007-12-30 15:30</td>
<td class="left">Time today</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right">31</td>
<td class="right">2007-12-31</td>
<td class="left">Day in the current month</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right">12-31</td>
<td class="right">2007-12-31</td>
<td class="left">Month and day in the current year</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right">2008-01-01</td>
<td class="right">2008-01-01</td>
<td class="left">Date</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right">2008-01-01 12:30am</td>
<td class="right">2008-01-01 00:30</td>
<td class="left">Date and time (also works with partial dates)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right">+2</td>
<td class="right">2008-12-31</td>
<td class="left">Two days from now</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right">-3</td>
<td class="right">2007-12-26</td>
<td class="left">Three days ago</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right">Fri</td>
<td class="right">2008-01-04</td>
<td class="left">The nearest Friday (on or after today)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right">+2w</td>
<td class="right">2008-01-12</td>
<td class="left">Two weeks from today</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
To set a deadline for a task, type C-c C-d (org-deadline). It accepts
the same kinds of date that org-schedule does.
</p>

<p>
Try this out by scheduling all of your tasks over the next few days,
adding deadlines where necessary.
</p>

<p>
Now that you've added date information to your tasks, you probably want
to see those tasks organized by date instead of in the random way you
entered them. Agenda views are going to become your new best friend.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Viewing your daily or weekly agenda</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Type C-c a a (org-agenda, org-agenda-list) to view your agenda. By
default, Org shows a weekly view of your scheduled tasks and
appointments. This is your Org agenda view.
</p>

<p>
Here are some useful navigational keys:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Switch to a daily view with d (org-agenda-day-view)
</li>
<li>Switch to a weekly view with w (org-agenda-week-view)
</li>
<li>View earlier or later days/weeks with your left and right arrow keys
(org-agenda-earlier, org-agenda-later)
</li>
<li>Jump to a specific day with j (org-agenda-goto-date)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Get into the habit of typing C-c a a to check your task list. It may
also help to add
</p>

<p>
(org-agenda-list)
</p>

<p>
to the bottom of your ~/.emacs. This opens your Org agenda view when you
start up Emacs. Start your Emacs day with your Org agenda, check it
every time you finish a task, and review it before you end the day. This
will help you make sure that nothing falls through the cracks.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Marking tasks as done</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The easiest way to mark a task as done is to go to its line in your Org
agenda view. Type C-c a a (org-agenda, org-agenda-list) to view your
tasks for today, move your cursor to the task, and type t
(org-agenda-todo) to cycle the task status until it's marked DONE. You
can also type C-u t (org-agenda-todo with a prefix argument) to jump to
a specific task status. For example, you could type C-u t DONE to mark a
task as done.
</p>

<p>
You can also mark tasks done from your ~/organizer.org file. Open the
file and move your cursor to the item. Type C-c C-t (org-todo) to change
the task status. Again, you can type C-u C-c C-t (org-todo) to jump to a
specific task status.
</p>

<p>
I find it helpful to mark tasks as STARTED when I start working on them,
WAITING if I need something else in order to continue working on the
task, and DONE when I'm finished with it. That way, I can quickly see
which task I was supposed to be working on before I got distracted by
something bright and shiny, and I can also see what I'm waiting for. Get
into the habit of doing that, and you'll find it easier to get back on
track after distractions.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, Org does not come with a M-x org-zap-distractions
command. There will be days when you can't do everything on your task
list.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Rescheduling Tasks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
You don't have to reschedule your tasks. Org will remind you of
unfinished, scheduled tasks every single day. It will even helpfully
tell you how many days you've procrastinated on that task. If you use
C-c a a (org-agenda, org-agenda-list) when you have unfinished tasks on
previous days, you'll see task reminders like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Saturday  29 December 2007
  organizer: Scheduled:  TODO Respond to mail
  organizer: Sched. 6x:  TODO Write notes from mentoring conversation
  organizer: Sched. 2x:  WAITING Report time
</pre>

<p>
You could let your unfinished tasks snowball on you in a big mass of
procrastination. If you let your task list grow to an intimidating size,
though, you may start stressing out about the things you aren't doing.
Let me show you how to procrastinate&#x2014;I mean, reschedule your tasks
effectively&#x2014;so that you can work with a more manageable task list.
</p>

<p>
If tasks are starting to accumulate, it's a good sign that you need to
review those tasks. Do you really need to do them? If not, delete them
by moving to the line in your Org agenda view and pressing C-k
(org-agenda-kill). You can also edit your ~/organizer.org file and
delete them, but org-agenda-kill is more convenient.
</p>

<p>
If you really need to do the tasks, but there's no point in seeing it in
today's task list because you can't do it today anyway, use C-c C-s
(org-agenda-schedule) to reschedule the task. If you're only moving it a
couple of days ahead, use S-right (org-agenda-later) to move it forward,
and S-left (org-agenda-earlier) if you overshoot.
</p>

<p>
Some tasks show up again and again on your task list, and you know you
need to do them, but you don't know where to getting started. “TODO
Write a book” is not a good task, because it's just too big to do in one
sitting and it doesn't tell you what to do right now. Big tasks are
often projects in disguise. Break it down into smaller tasks, and
schedule those instead. If you're in the Org agenda view, press RET
(org-agenda-switch-to) to jump to the task in your ~/organizer.org file.
Break it down into smaller tasks by adding sub-headings and more TODOs,
like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
** Write a book
*** TODO Make an outline of what to write
*** TODO Read sample query letters
*** TODO Write a query letter
</pre>

<p>
&#x2026; and so on.
</p>

<p>
Then you can use C-c C-s (org-schedule) to schedule those tasks.
</p>

<p>
Use these commands to keep your task list manageable. That way, you get
the warm and fuzzy feeling of accomplishment when you finish what's on
your list and you look at everything you've done today.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Reviewing your accomplishments</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
If you've been good about keeping your tasks in your ~/organizer.org
file, working with your Org agenda view, and marking tasks as DONE when
you finish them, you'll find it easy (and satisfying!) to review your
accomplishments. Just open your daily or weekly Org agenda view with C-c
a a (org-agenda, org-agenda-list). Type l (org-agenda-log-mode) to show
completed tasks. Pat yourself on the back, then plan yourself another
wonderful day tomorrow!
