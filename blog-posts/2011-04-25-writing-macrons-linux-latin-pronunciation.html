<p>
Frustrated with the inability to search the scanned images of the 1822
Latin textbook we're using (Albert Harkness'
<a href="http://www.archive.org/details/aneasymethodfor00harkgoog">An Easy
Method for Beginners in Latin</a> &#x2013; get the PDF, the full-text version is
badly OCRed), W- has taken it upon himself to recreate the public-domain
textbook as a fully searchable TiddlyWiki (sans illustrations). This
meant that he needed to type in a great number of macrons in the words,
and <i>that</i> meant finding a better way than copying and pasting from
KDE's character map.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macron">Macrons</a> turn up in many
languages. In Japanese, you use them to indicate that vowels are
doubled. 大阪（おおさか）can be romanized as Oosaka or Ōsaka. In Latin,
beginner textbooks often use macrons (macra) to indicate pronunciation.
(Why do we care about pronunciation for a dead language used mostly in
church hymns? W- and I actually want to be able to use this
conversationally, at least with each other. After all, if you don't use
it, you lose it.)
</p>

<p>
I suggested Emacs. In Emacs, it's just a matter of using
<code>M-x set-input-method</code> to choose <code>latin-alt-postfix</code>. With that input
method, you can add macrons to letters by typing &#x2013; after them. For
example, typing “a -” will result in ā. Not only that, dynamic
abbreviations (<code>M-/</code>) make it easier to retype words you've already
written before.
</p>

<p>
W- wouldn't hear of using Emacs, being almost as firmly wedded to <code>vi</code>
as he is to me. ;)
</p>

<p>
Instead, we spent some time figuring out how to set up KDE and gvim to
make it easier for him to type in macrons. HTML character sequences were
out of the question, of course. W- used KDE's settings to map his unused
Windows key and menu key to compose keys. That made it easier to produce
ē, ī, ō, and ū using the key sequence “Compose + hyphen + vowel”.
However, “Compose + hyphen + a” produced ã, not ā. This was probably a
bug based on some issue reports we found on the Net, but the suggested
fix didn't work (im-switch -c to change to default-xim). I found a page
describing an <code>.XCompose</code> fix, customizing the key sequences. He copied
the relevant key sequences from en-US's locale settings for Compose in
<code>/usr/share/X11</code>, restarted X, and it worked.
</p>

<p>
Now he's off and typing!
