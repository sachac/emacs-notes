Niklas Morberg sent me an e-mail about planner.el support for Dave
 Allen's “Getting Things Done” method. This is the first time I've
 heard of it, but it'd be nice to see if we can hack planner to support
it.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.davidco.com/coaches_corner/">Coach's Corner</a> on the
 linked site has well-thought articles.

Your Inbox “Real”</a>
</p>

<p>
I archive as much of my mail as possible because it's easy to search
 through information. Creating tasks from e-mail messages allows me to
 quickly deal with e-mail associated with actions. I can create vague
 tasks and refine them as necessary, although the associated task is
 usually clear. Gnus hides old messages, so my Inbox view shows me only
 unread messages unless I specifically ask for archives.
</p>

<p>
I prefer to archive everything instead of making keep/no-keep
 decisions for my e-mail. I have false positives (mail that I thought
 might be important but which I never referred to again) and false
 negatives (mail I hardly looked at, but needed to find afterwards). I
 rely on search and filtering tools to quickly pull relevant messages
 out of my archive. I think that this is more effective than frequent
 review and selection of messages to be kept.
</p>

<p>
I remember reading a paper about e-mail archiving strategies. I ran a
 full-text search for a phrase I remembered from the mail, and I turned
 up the PDF that the author sent me. You can look up Richard Boardman's
 paper on “‘Stuff goes into the computer and doesn't come out': A
 Cross-tool Study of Personal Information Management”&#x2014;it's an
 informative survey of different e-mail filing techniques.
</p>

<p>
The GTD method suggests determining what the successful outcomes are
 (“projects”), what my next action is and what I am waiting for.
 planner.el supports “next action” and “waiting for” with unfinished
 and pending tasks. I specify desired outcome in the task description.
 I don't have a concept of “Project” yet, unless you count the plan
 pages.

through procrastination easily</a>
</p>

<p>
Visualizing the expected outcome makes it easier to plan tasks and
 overcome procrastination. planner.el has no explicit support for
 reminding the user of the positive outcome associated with the task,
 but it can be included in the task description or on the linked
 project page. A better approach, however, might be to have the
 expected outcome show as a tooltip or minibuffer message in order to
 provide better positive reinforcement.
</p>

<p>
John Wiegley's essay on planning uses top-down stepwise refinement to
 break general tasks down into smaller and smaller tasks until they can
 be scheduled. This overcomes procrastination by making planning a
 semi-mechanical process and simplifying the tasks until they are no
 longer intimidatingly complex.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, the GTD method suggests starting with the immediate next
 step&#x2014;a bottom-up approach. This is similar to the way I use
 planner.el, planning one or two tasks in advance. Occasionally,
 however, I find it useful to create overview tasks. This gives me an
 overview of the entire project and allows me to get a handle on my
 timeframe.

‘this' for everything</a>
</p>

<p>
I've used other personal information managers before, but
 Emacs+planner+remember makes it easy for me to keep track of my work.
 If I think of something to be done, a few keystrokes will put it on my
 TODO list.
</p>

<p>
I capture a lot of information. remember.el makes it easy for me to
 create short blog entries linked to the current context and associated
 with a date and planner page.
</p>

<p>
So yes, I do ‘this' for everything. Being able to reschedule tasks for
 future dates means I don't have to worry about things until then. Of
 course, I tend to procrastinate a fair bit (specifying tomorrow with
 +1 comes in handy!), but it's nice to know that I'll eventually run
 into those tasks again. If planner.el reminded me of the benefits of
 completing the task, I'll probably be more motivated to finish them.

</p>

<p>
Oy, here we go with that procrastination thing. Guilty! Being able to
 reschedule tasks does make it all too easy to push things onto a pile
 of things to be done later. However, having all these actions floating
 around does mean I have no excuse to slack off (unless scheduled in).
 This particular essay is a bit on the fluffy side, though.

a Complete Inventory of Your Projects</a>
</p>

<p>
Ah. “Projects” are like plan pages in that they are collections of
 tasks. However, plan pages can also be roles or contexts.
</p>

<p>
planner.el needs a good way to review active projects. Right now,
 people can manually maintain a list. However, one needs to visit all
 the individual project pages in order to visualize the end results or
 see how far one has gotten based on the tasks.
</p>

<p>
A graph would be nice. It could show only active projects (projects
 with at least one unfinished task) or all projects (possibly limited
 by date or regexp.) Progress could be measured by ratio of unfinished
 tasks to all tasks, or manually indicated by a #progress directive or
 some kind of progress marker in each task.
</p>

<p>
I review tasks every day, but maybe I could also review the end
 results every week as part of an accomplishment report. The
 accomplishment report could list statistics for tasks finished
 (grouped by project) and allow easy viewing of current projects (all
 projects mentioned in tasks/notes this week). How can we modify
 planner.el to support that?

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
How can I can remember things that are on my calendar but aren't
time-specific?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sounds like the problem I have with un-dated tasks. GTD gets around
 this by having people review pages based on their context. After going
 through all of your day-specific tasks, you can then go through your
 context-based action lists to find out what to do next.
</p>

<p>
Context-based action lists is probably more efficient if most of your
 work is guided by context. It can be simulated in planner.el by
 associating the tasks with plan pages for each context. However, since
 most of my work centers on the computer, I like seeing a list of all
 my tasks. I prefer to sit down and plan my day beforehand, rearranging
 tasks so that I put similar tasks together. If the opportunity arises,
 I can do tasks out of sequence.
</p>

<p>
I can also use planner.el to see other tasks in the same context. For
 example, when I want to do more
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/PlannerMode">PlannerMode</a> work, I
can just look at
 my <a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/PlannerMode">PlannerMode</a> page
to see&#x2026; a heck of a lot of tasks.
</p>

<p>
In GTD, day-specifics are tasks that MUST be done on that day. I
 prefer having my low-priority tasks still visible, using high-priority
 tasks and deadlines in task descriptions to mark the things I should
 do by today. Some people plan their tasks the GTD way, though.
 Specifying ‘nil' for a task date allows you to associate it with a
 plan page but no date page. Scheduling only day-specific tasks makes
 sure you don't ignore your task list, so I guess that's a good thing.
</p>

<p>
<b>How do you handle weekly tasks that are not specific to a particular
day of the week?</b>
</p>

<p>
I assign weekly tasks to a particular day. Makes it easier to get into
the rhythm of things.
</p>

<p>
<b>Most of the day I am dealing with actions I am expected to do. Most of
them have a due date. Where should I place my reminder?</b>
</p>

<p>
Okay, I'm starting to get the hang of the next-action thing. To
 support GTD, I'd need a way to get a quick overview of the next-step
 tasks as part of the list of active projects. I'd also need to be able
 to look at today's schedule and today's day-specific task list.
</p>

<p>
Tech note: It looks like planner.el can be extended to do this by
 adding a tag that gets replaced by project outcome and the first task.
 The main problem we need to solve is that tasks can appear on more
 than two pages. I think this can almost be done with existing tools.
 However, planner-copy-or-move-region shouldn't mess with these tasks.
 It's probably better to create new markup rules for them&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
<b>Is it true that David Allen uses the generic Palm Desktop and handheld
software, and doesn't particularly recommend any add-on programs?</b>
</p>

<p>
I find remember.el an excellent way of tracking events, as it gives me
 a historical log as well as a topic-tracked one. I need to find a way
 to reassign topics and add multiple topics to a note. This depends on
 getting note IDs to work.
</p>

<p>
<b>Areas of focus vs. someday/maybe</b>
</p>

<p>
Tech note: Hmm. This sounds like a good candidate for automatic
 rewriting. People can manually maintain a list of projects, and have
 outcomes and next tasks automatically filled in.
</p>

<p>
<b>How do you recommend keeping project notes and/or support material?</b>
</p>

<p>
Ooh, planner hyperlinking is great for that. I keep most of my support
 materials in my planner wiki and hyperlink out when I need to refer to
 external sources or files on my hard disk.
