<h1 class="title">New note-taking workflow with Emacs Org-mode</h1>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The new workflow looks like it works better for me. Or rather, it's an
old workflow with new tools. Now, instead of using Windows Live Writer
or ScribeFire to post my notes directly to my blog, I'm back to using
M-x remember and Emacs, keeping a superset of my notes in text files and
publishing selected parts of it.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The new workflow

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>M-x remember saves quick notes into a large text file
(~/personal/organizer.org), possibly with tags, with diagrams
inserted later.
</li>
<li>I regularly review and file items into the appropriate sections of
~/personal/outline.org.
</li>
<li>I post selected items to my blog using C-u M-x
org2blog-post-subtree, scheduling them by adding a timestamp or
using the C-c C-s (org-schedule) command.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I sometimes use Microsoft OneNote on my new tablet to take notes
during meetings, but it's easy enough to convert my handwriting to
text and paste it into my Org-mode file. I still have to think of a
better way to refer to images while keeping my file manageable, but a
filename is probably okay.
</p>
</li>

<li>A worked example

<p>
This is being composed in a M-x remember window. (Well, remember is
bound to C-c r on my system, so it's easy to invoke).
</p>

<p>
After I finish braindumping, I'll use C-c C-c to save it somewhere.
</p>

<p>
I may schedule the post immediately (C-c s (org-schedule) and then
C-u M-x org2blog-post-subtree), or tag it for later review. (:toblog:
&#x2013; ready to go, but not scheduled? :rough: &#x2013; needs more thinking?)
</p>

<p>
When I review the items, I'll copy this into the Geek &#x2013; Emacs
section of my outline.org.
</p>

<p>
It feels nice having my notes in plain text, and being able to
organize it in more than just chronological order&#x2026;
</p>
</li>

<li>The history

<p>
From 2001 to about 2006, I kept an Emacs Planner wiki with all of my
notes in it. Emacs Remember let me write notes that were
automatically hyperlinked to whatever I was looking at, and I added
code to Planner that made it easy for me to file the notes both
chronologically and topically. Planner rocked. I loved being able to
easily hyperlink between topics, and the wiki structure kept pages a
mostly manageable size. (My
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/PlannerMode.php">public Planner
files</a> are still on the Net, but I need to regenerate the index or
enable directory lists so that they're usable.)
</p>

<p>
When I moved to WordPress as a blogging platform in order to make it
easier for people to leave comments, I hacked around with RSS to
import my posts from Planner into WordPress (ex:
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2002/"><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2002/">http://sachachua.com/blog/2002/</a></a>).
Moving to WordPress meant a change in my workflow. I now had two
places to store my notes: Planner and my blog.
</p>

<p>
I tried Emacs Org because I liked the way it organized information.
In Planner, we'd been struggling with elegant ways to manage tasks
and notes that needed to be accessed in multiple contexts. The
approach we had taken in Planner was to make copies of the
information, but Org had a cleaner way to do it using different
views. It was intriguing.
</p>

<p>
When I started working at IBM, however, my information workflow
diverged. I shifted to using a web-based to-do list and Lotus Notes,
posting on an internal blog and an external one, and managing
multiple sources and repositories of information.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to go back to keeping my notes in plain text, encrypted if
necessary, and to have a place where I could keep notes that might
not be publishable. I still had to manage multiple computers, but
synchronizing systems like Dropbox or SpiderOak got rid of some of
the hassles I'd encountered with git. When I found out about org2blog
thanks to a test link from punchagan, I
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2010/07/using-org2blog-to-publish-org-mode-subtrees/">modified
the code to work with subtrees instead of new buffers</a>, and that
solved the blog publishing part of it.
